Okay, so I have these two integral equations to solve for continuous functions x(t) and y(t). Let's write them out again:
1. \( x(t) = 1 + \int_{0}^{t} e^{-2(t - s)} x(s) \, ds \)
2. \( y(t) = \int_{0}^{t} e^{-2(t - s)} \{ 2x(s) + 3y(s) \} \, ds \)
Hmm, both equations are Volterra integral equations of the second kind, right?
The kernel is \( e^{-2(t - s)} \), which looks like a convolution kernel because it depends on t - s.
Maybe I can convert these integral equations into differential equations using differentiation.
Since the integral is from 0 to t, differentiation might simplify things because the derivative of such an integral with a convolution kernel can relate to the original function.
Starting with the first equation for x(t):
\( x(t) = 1 + \int_{0}^{t} e^{-2(t - s)} x(s) \, ds \)
Let me denote the integral part as \( \int_{0}^{t} e^{-2(t - s)} x(s) \, ds \). Let's call this integral I(t). So,
\( x(t) = 1 + I(t) \)
Now, to find a differential equation, I should compute the derivative dx/dt. Let's differentiate both sides with respect to t.
d/dt [x(t)] = d/dt [1] + d/dt [I(t)]
The derivative of 1 is 0, so we have:
\( x'(t) = \frac{d}{dt} \int_{0}^{t} e^{-2(t - s)} x(s) \, ds \)
To differentiate this integral, which has the variable t both in the upper limit and inside the integrand, we can use Leibniz's rule. The general formula is:
d/dt [∫_{a(t)}^{b(t)} f(t, s) ds] = f(t, b(t)) * b'(t) - f(t, a(t)) * a'(t) + ∫_{a(t)}^{b(t)} ∂f/∂t ds
In our case, a(t) = 0, so a'(t) = 0; b(t) = t, so b'(t) = 1. The integrand is f(t, s) = e^{-2(t - s)} x(s), so ∂f/∂t = -2 e^{-2(t - s)} x(s).
Applying Leibniz's rule:
x'(t) = e^{-2(t - t)} x(t) * 1 - 0 + ∫_{0}^{t} (-2) e^{-2(t - s)} x(s) ds
Simplify each term:
e^{-2(t - t)} x(t) = e^{0} x(t) = x(t)
So,
x'(t) = x(t) - 2 ∫_{0}^{t} e^{-2(t - s)} x(s) ds
But notice that the integral here is exactly I(t), which is equal to x(t) - 1 from the original equation. Substitute that in:
x'(t) = x(t) - 2(x(t) - 1) = x(t) - 2x(t) + 2 = -x(t) + 2
Therefore, the differential equation for x(t) is:
x'(t) = -x(t) + 2
This is a linear first-order ordinary differential equation. Let's solve it.
The standard form is x' + P(t) x = Q(t). Here, we can rewrite the equation as:
x'(t) + x(t) = 2
So, P(t) = 1, Q(t) = 2.
Integrating factor mu(t) is exp(∫ P(t) dt) = exp(t).
Multiplying both sides by exp(t):
exp(t) x'(t) + exp(t) x(t) = 2 exp(t)
The left side is the derivative of [exp(t) x(t)]:
d/dt [exp(t) x(t)] = 2 exp(t)
Integrate both sides:
exp(t) x(t) = 2 ∫ exp(t) dt + C = 2 exp(t) + C
Therefore, divide both sides by exp(t):
x(t) = 2 + C exp(-t)
Now apply the initial condition.

Therefore, the solution for x(t) is:

1: The integral equation for y(t) is \( y(t) = \int_{0}^{t} e^{-2(t - s)} [2x(s) + 3y(s)] ds \), which is a Volterra equation. Let the integral be denoted as J(t), so y(t) = J(t). Differentiating both sides yields y'(t) = d/dt J(t).
Leibniz's rule is applied to differentiate the integral.
The integration is from 0 to t with the integrand \( e^{-2(t - s)} [2x(s) + 3y(s)] \).
The derivative d/dt J(t) is \( e^{-2(t - t)} [2x(t) + 3y(t)] \cdot 1 + \int_{0}^{t} \frac{\partial}{\partial t} [e^{-2(t - s)} (2x(s) + 3y(s))] ds \).
The first term simplifies to \( e^{0} [2x(t) + 3y(t)] = 2x(t) + 3y(t) \).
The second term evaluates to \( \int_{0}^{t} [-2 e^{-2(t - s)} (2x(s) + 3y(s))] ds = -2 J(t) = -2 y(t) \).
Combining the terms results in \( y'(t) = 2x(t) + 3y(t) - 2y(t) = 2x(t) + y(t) \).
The resulting differential equation for y(t) is \( y'(t) - y(t) = 2x(t) \).
Substituting the known solution \( x(t) = 2 - e^{-t} \) gives \( y' - y = 2(2 - e^{-t}) = 4 - 2e^{-t} \).
This equation is a linear ordinary differential equation for y(t).
The equation is written as \( y'(t) - y(t) = 4 - 2e^{-t} \).
The integrating factor is \( e^{\int -1 dt} = e^{-t} \).
Multiplying by the integrating factor gives \( e^{-t} y' - e^{-t} y = (4 - 2e^{-t}) e^{-t} \).
The left side is the derivative \( \frac{d}{dt} [e^{-t} y(t)] \), which equals \( 4e^{-t} - 2e^{-2t} \).
Integrating both sides yields \( e^{-t} y(t) = \int (4e^{-t} - 2e^{-2t}) dt + C \).
The integrals are \( \int e^{-t} dt = -e^{-t} + C_1 \) and \( \int e^{-2t} dt = -\frac{1}{2} e^{-2t} + C_2 \).
Substituting the integrated terms gives \( e^{-t} y(t) = 4(-e^{-t}) - 2(-\frac{1}{2} e^{-2t}) + C \).
This simplifies to \( e^{-t} y(t) = -4e^{-t} + e^{-2t} + C \).
Multiplying by \( e^{t} \) gives \( y(t) = -4e^{0} + e^{-t} + Ce^{t} \).
The general solution is \( y(t) = -4 + e^{-t} + Ce^{t} \).
An initial condition is needed to determine the constant C.

1.2: The general solution for y(t) is \(y(t) = -4 + e^{-t} + C e^{t}\). Applying the initial condition y(0)=0 by substituting t=0 yields \(y(0) = -4 + e^{-0} + C e^{0}\). This leads to \(0 = -4 + 1 + C\), which simplifies to \(0 = -3 + C\), resulting in C = 3.

Substituting x(t) and x'(t) into the differential equation \( x'(t) = -x(t) + 2 \), the left side is \( e^{-t} \). The right side is \( -(2 - e^{-t}) + 2 = -2 + e^{-t} + 2 = e^{-t} \). The equality holds, confirming the solution x(t).

The solution \( y(t) = -4 + e^{-t} + 3 e^{t} \) was derived, and the solution \( x(t) = 2 - e^{-t} \) was verified using its differential equation.

Check the derived solution y(t).
First, compute LHS: y(t) = -4 + e^{-t} + 3 e^{t}
Compute RHS: ∫_{0}^{t} e^{-2(t-s)} [2x(s) + 3y(s)] ds
But first, recall x(s) = 2 - e^{-s}, so 2x(s) = 4 - 2e^{-s}
Then, 3y(s) = 3(-4 + e^{-s} + 3 e^{s}) = -12 + 3 e^{-s} + 9 e^{s}
Thus, 2x(s) + 3y(s) = (4 -2 e^{-s}) + (-12 +3 e^{-s} +9 e^{s}) = (4 -12) + (-2 e^{-s} +3 e^{-s}) +9 e^{s} = -8 + e^{-s} +9 e^{s}
So the integral becomes: ∫_{0}^{t} e^{-2(t - s)} [ -8 + e^{-s} +9 e^{s} ] ds
Factor out e^{-2t} from the exponential: e^{-2t} ∫_{0}^{t} e^{2s} [ -8 + e^{-s} +9 e^{s} ] ds
Compute the integrand: e^{2s} [ -8 + e^{-s} +9 e^{s} ] = -8 e^{2s} + e^{2s} e^{-s} +9 e^{2s} e^{s} = -8 e^{2s} + e^{s} +9 e^{3s}
Therefore, the integral: e^{-2t} [ -8 ∫_{0}^{t} e^{2s} ds + ∫_{0}^{t} e^{s} ds +9 ∫_{0}^{t} e^{3s} ds ]
Compute each integral:
First integral: ∫ e^{2s} ds from 0 to t is (1/2)(e^{2t} - 1)
Second integral: ∫ e^{s} ds from 0 to t is (e^{t} -1)
Third integral: ∫ e^{3s} ds from 0 to t is (1/3)(e^{3t} -1 )
So putting it all together: e^{-2t} [ -8*(1/2)(e^{2t} -1) + (e^{t} -1) +9*(1/3)(e^{3t}-1) ]
Simplify: e^{-2t} [ -4(e^{2t} -1) + (e^t -1) +3(e^{3t} -1) ]
= e^{-2t} [ -4 e^{2t} +4 + e^t -1 + 3 e^{3t} -3 ]
Combine constants: 4 -1 -3 = 0
So,
= e^{-2t} [ -4 e^{2t} + e^t +3 e^{3t} ]
Divide the exponentials:
= e^{-2t}*(-4 e^{2t}) + e^{-2t}*e^t + e^{-2t}*3 e^{3t}
= -4 e^{0} + e^{-t} + 3 e^{t}
= -4 + e^{-t} +3 e^{t}
Which matches y(t) computed earlier. So the solution satisfies the integral equation. Therefore, y(t) is correct.
For y(t):
y'(t) = derivative of (3 e^{t} + e^{-t} -4) is 3 e^{t} - e^{-t}
Plug into y' = 2x + y:
Left side: 3 e^t - e^{-t}
Right side: 2*(2 - e^{-t}) + (3 e^t + e^{-t} -4) = 4 - 2 e^{-t} +3 e^t + e^{-t} -4 = 3 e^t - e^{-t}
Which matches. Perfect.
So all checks out.
**Final Answer**
The continuous functions are \(\boxed{x(t) = 2 - e^{-t}}\) and \(\boxed{y(t) = 3e^{t} + e^{-t} - 4}\).
