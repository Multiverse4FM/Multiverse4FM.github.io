Alright, let me try to figure out this problem.
So, we have to evaluate this expression involving inverse trigonometric functions: \[\frac{3}{2} \cos ^{-1} \sqrt{\frac{2}{2+\pi^{2}}} + \frac{1}{4} \sin ^{-1} \frac{2 \sqrt{2} \pi}{2+\pi^{2}} + \tan ^{-1} \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\pi}\]
Hmm, okay.
Let me take this step by step.
First, I recall that inverse trigonometric functions can sometimes be related to each other, especially if their arguments are connected.
Maybe there's a way to express some terms in terms of angles that would simplify the addition.
Let me see.
Starting with the first term: \(\frac{3}{2} \cos ^{-1} \sqrt{\frac{2}{2+\pi^{2}}}\).
Let me denote \(\theta = \cos^{-1} \sqrt{\frac{2}{2+\pi^{2}}}\).
Then, \(\cos \theta = \sqrt{\frac{2}{2+\pi^{2}}}\).
Squaring both sides, we get \(\cos^2 \theta = \frac{2}{2 + \pi^2}\).
Then, using the identity \(\sin^2 \theta = 1 - \cos^2 \theta\), so: \(\sin^2 \theta = 1 - \frac{2}{2 + \pi^2} = \frac{(2 + \pi^2) - 2}{2 + \pi^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{2 + \pi^2}\).
So, \(\sin \theta = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2 + \pi^2}}\), since \(\theta\) is in the principal range of \(\cos^{-1}\) which is [0, π], so sine is non-negative here.
Therefore, \(\theta = \sin^{-1} \left( \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2 + \pi^2}} \right)\).
Wait, but not sure if that helps directly.
Let's see the second term: \(\frac{1}{4} \sin^{-1} \frac{2\sqrt{2}\pi}{2 + \pi^2}\).
Let me denote \(\phi = \sin^{-1} \frac{2\sqrt{2}\pi}{2 + \pi^2}\).
So, \(\sin \phi = \frac{2\sqrt{2}\pi}{2 + \pi^2}\).
Third term is \(\tan^{-1} \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\pi}\).
Let's denote \(\psi = \tan^{-1} \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\pi}\).
So, \(\tan \psi = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\pi}\).
Hmmm, okay.
So, I have three angles: θ, φ, and ψ, all related to π and √2.
Maybe there's a relationship between these angles.
Since all terms involve π and √2, perhaps they add up to a multiple of π or something.
Alternatively, maybe θ and φ can be expressed in terms of ψ or vice versa.
Let's explore more.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>

2: Explore the relationship between \(\theta\) and \(\psi\) by calculating \(\tan \theta\) and comparing it with \(\tan \psi\), then determine the exact relationship.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: First, let me see if there is a connection between θ and φ.
From θ, we had: \(\cos \theta = \sqrt{\frac{2}{2 + \pi^2}}\), so squaring both sides, \(\cos^2 \theta = \frac{2}{2 + \pi^2}\), which implies \(\sin^2 \theta = \frac{\pi^2}{2 + \pi^2}\).
Compare this with the expression inside the second term's inverse sine: \(\frac{2\sqrt{2}\pi}{2 + \pi^2}\).
Let's note that:
The sine of φ is \(\frac{2\sqrt{2}\pi}{2 + \pi^2}\).
Let me square that: \(\sin^2 \phi = \left( \frac{2\sqrt{2}\pi}{2 + \pi^2} \right)^2 = \frac{8\pi^2}{(2 + \pi^2)^2}\).
Also, we can compute:
If we take the expression from θ's cosine: \(\cos \theta = \sqrt{\frac{2}{2+\pi^2}}\), then \(\sin \theta = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2 + \pi^2}}\).
Let's compute \(\sin(2\theta)\): \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta = 2 * \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2 + \pi^2}} * \sqrt{\frac{2}{2 + \pi^2}} = 2\pi * \sqrt{\frac{2}{(2 + \pi^2)^2}} = \frac{2\pi\sqrt{2}}{2 + \pi^2}\).
Wait a minute!
That's exactly the argument inside the inverse sine in the second term.
So, \(\sin(2θ) = \frac{2\sqrt{2}\pi}{2 + \pi^2} = \sin \phi\).
So, does that mean that φ = 2θ or φ = π - 2θ, considering the range of inverse sine?
Given that φ is the principal value of inverse sine, which is in [-π/2, π/2], but since the argument is positive, φ is in [0, π/2].
Similarly, θ was in [0, π/2], since cosine is positive.
Wait, θ was from arccos of a positive number, so θ is in [0, π/2] because the argument is positive.
Wait, actually, arccos outputs in [0, π], but since the argument is positive, yes, θ is in [0, π/2], because cosine is positive there.
Because if theta were in [π/2, π], cosine would be negative, but our argument for arccos is positive, so theta is in [0, π/2].
Therefore, 2θ would be in [0, π].
However, phi is an arcsine, so phi is in [-π/2, π/2].
But since the argument is positive, phi is in [0, π/2].
Therefore, if sin(phi) = sin(2θ), and both phi and 2θ are in [0, π] where sine is positive, then phi = 2θ or phi = π - 2θ.
But phi is in [0, π/2], and 2θ could be up to π.
Wait, 2θ where theta is in [0, π/2], so 2θ is in [0, π].
So, if 2θ is less than or equal to π/2, then phi = 2θ.
If 2θ is more than π/2, then phi = π - 2θ.
Let's check:
What is theta?
theta is arccos sqrt(2/(2 + pi^2))
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>

1.1: Approximate values for \(\theta\)-related terms like \(2+\pi^2\), \(\cos \theta\), \(\theta\), and \(2\theta\), and then evaluate the implications for \(\phi\) based on \(2\theta\)'s value relative to \(\pi/2\).
</Outline>
<Outline>
1.2: Approximate values for \(\phi\)-related terms like the argument of \(\sin^{-1}\) and \(\phi\) itself, and then compare with \(\sin(2\theta)\) from accurate calculations.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1.1: Let me approximate the value of theta.
Let me compute sqrt(2/(2 + pi^2)).
First, compute 2 + pi^2: pi is approximately 3.14, so pi^2 is around 9.8696, so 2 + pi^2 ≈ 11.8696.
So sqrt(2 / 11.8696) ≈ sqrt(0.1685) ≈ 0.4106.
Then arccos(0.4106) is approximately 65 degrees or 1.13 radians.
So 2θ would be approximately 130 degrees or 2.26 radians.
But phi is arcsine(sin(2θ)), but since sin(2θ) is positive and 2θ is 130 degrees (which is in [0, pi=180 degrees]), and phi is the principal value, which would be in [-90,90] degrees.
Wait, 130 degrees is greater than 90, so the arcsine of sin(130 degrees) is 180 - 130 = 50 degrees.
Hmm.
So arcsine(sin(2θ)) would be pi - 2θ if 2θ is in (pi/2, 3pi/2).
But since 2θ is less than pi in this case, actually, wait.
130 degrees is between pi/2 and pi (90 to 180), so the arcsine of sin(130 degrees) is pi - 130 degrees, which is 50 degrees, right?
So phi = pi - 2θ.
But let's test numerically.
For example, theta ≈ 1.13 radians, so 2θ ≈ 2.26 radians.
Then sin(2θ) ≈ sin(2.26) ≈ 0.802.
</Path>
<Path>
1.2: The argument for phi is 2sqrt(2)pi / (2 + pi2).
Let's compute this:
2sqrt(2)pi ≈ 2*1.414*3.14 ≈ 8.885
Divided by 2 + pi2 ≈ 11.8696.
So approx 8.885 / 11.8696 ≈ 0.749.
Wait, that's what I got before, but sin(2θ) was approximated as 0.802.
Wait, actually, let's do this accurately.
Compute 2sqrt(2)pi / (2 + pi^2).
First, 2 + pi^2 ≈ 11.8696
pi ≈ 3.1416, sqrt2 ≈ 1.4142
So 2sqrt(2)*pi ≈ 2*1.4142*3.1416 ≈ 2*4.4429 ≈ 8.8858
So 8.8858 / 11.8696 ≈ 0.7489
So sin(phi) = 0.7489 => phi ≈ arcsin(0.7489) ≈ 0.847 radians or approx 48.5 degrees.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
Numerical approximation of \(\theta\) and \(2\theta\) suggests \(2\theta \approx 130^\circ\), implying \(\phi = \pi - 2\theta\).
Numerical calculation of the argument of \(\sin^{-1}\) for \(\phi\) gives approximately 0.7489, leading to \(\phi \approx 48.5^\circ\). The initial approximation of \(\sin(2\theta)\) was slightly off, but accurate calculation of the argument \(\frac{2\sqrt{2}\pi}{2+\pi^2}\) is consistent.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Meanwhile, 2θ: theta = arccos(sqrt(2/(2 + pi2)))
sqrt(2/(2 + pi2)) ≈ sqrt(2/11.8696) ≈ sqrt(0.1685) ≈ 0.4106.
So theta ≈ arccos(0.4106) ≈ 1.147 radians or 65.7 degrees.
So 2θ ≈ 2.294 radians or 131.4 degrees.
Then sin(2θ) ≈ sin(2.294) ≈ sin(131.4 degrees) ≈ 0.749.
Indeed, this is equal to the value we calculated as sin(phi) = 0.7489.
So sin(phi) = sin(2θ).
But now, since phi is an angle in [-pi/2, pi/2], and arcsine would output the angle in this range with the given sine.
Therefore, sin(phi) = sin(2θ), but since 2θ is 131.4 degrees which is in the second quadrant, then phi = pi - 2θ.
Wait, pi - 2θ ≈ 3.1416 - 2.294 ≈ 0.847 radians, which is approximately 48.5 degrees, which is the arcsine of that value.
So phi = pi - 2theta.
Therefore, phi = pi - 2theta.
So, that gives a relation between phi and theta.
Therefore, phi = pi - 2theta.
Hmm, useful.
So now, we can substitute phi in terms of theta.
</Path>
<Path>
2: Also, let's move to the third term, tan^{-1}(sqrt2 / pi).
Let's denote that as psi.
Then tan psi = sqrt2 / pi ≈ 1.414 / 3.1416 ≈ 0.45, so psi ≈ arctan(0.45) ≈ 0.422 radians or about 24.2 degrees.
Now, trying to find if theta and psi are related.
Let's recall that theta = arccos(sqrt(2/(2 + pi2))).
Let's consider whether theta is related to psi.
Perhaps theta is equal to some combination of psi?
Alternatively, perhaps if we set up a triangle to represent theta.
Let me imagine a right triangle where the adjacent side is sqrt(2), and the hypotenuse is sqrt(2 + pi2).
Wait, because cos(theta) = sqrt(2/(2 + pi)) = sqrt(2)/sqrt(2 + pi2), so if adjacent is sqrt(2) and hypotenuse is sqrt(2 + pi2), then the opposite side is pi, which was found earlier.
So in such a triangle, opposite is pi, adjacent is sqrt(2), hypotenuse sqrt(2 + pi2).
Then tan(theta) = opposite / adjacent = pi / sqrt(2).
Wait, so tan(theta) = pi / sqrt(2).
But our third term is tan(psi) = sqrt(2)/pi.
Which is reciprocal.
So tan(theta) = pi / sqrt(2) and tan(psi) = sqrt(2)/pi.
So this suggests that theta + psi = pi/2, because if tan(theta) = cot(psi) = tan(pi/2 - psi), so theta = pi/2 - psi.
Yes!
Let's check.
If tan(theta) = pi / sqrt(2), and tan(psi) = sqrt(2)/pi, which is 1 / tan(theta).
Therefore, tan(psi) = 1 / tan(theta) = cot(theta), which means psi + theta = pi/2.
Because tan(psi) = cot(theta) = tan(pi/2 - theta).
Since both psi and theta are in [0, pi/2], then psi = pi/2 - theta.
So yes!
So psi = pi/2 - theta.
Cool, so that's another relation.
Now, let's substitute.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The relationship \(\phi = \pi - 2\theta\) was established by analyzing \(\sin(2\theta) = \sin\phi\) and considering the principal value ranges, supported by numerical approximations showing \(2\theta > \pi/2\).
The relationship \(\psi = \pi/2 - \theta\) was established by finding \(\tan\theta = \pi/\sqrt{2}\) and \(\tan\psi = \sqrt{2}/\pi\), thus \(\tan\psi = \cot\theta\), and since both \(\theta, \psi \in [0, \pi/2]\), they are complementary.

</Parallel>
Original expression: (3/2)theta + (1/4)phi + psi
But we found that phi = pi - 2theta and psi = pi/2 - theta.
Therefore, substitute: (3/2)theta + (1/4)(pi - 2theta) + (pi/2 - theta)
Simplify each term:
First term: (3/2)theta
Second term: (1/4)pi - (1/4)(2theta) = (1/4)pi - (1/2)theta
Third term: pi/2 - theta

1: The connection between \(\theta\) and \(\phi\) is investigated. Given \(\cos \theta = \sqrt{\frac{2}{2 + \pi^2}}\), squaring yields \(\cos^2 \theta = \frac{2}{2 + \pi^2}\), which implies \(\sin^2 \theta = \frac{\pi^2}{2 + \pi^2}\). The argument of the second term's inverse sine, \(\frac{2\sqrt{2}\pi}{2 + \pi^2}\), is considered for comparison. The sine of \(\phi\) is \(\frac{2\sqrt{2}\pi}{2 + \pi^2}\), and squaring \(\sin\phi\) gives \(\sin^2 \phi = \frac{8\pi^2}{(2 + \pi^2)^2}\).
From \(\cos \theta = \sqrt{\frac{2}{2+\pi^2}}\), \(\sin \theta = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2 + \pi^2}}\) is derived.
Then, \(\sin(2\theta)\) is calculated as \(2 \sin \theta \cos \theta = 2 \cdot \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2 + \pi^2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2}{2 + \pi^2}} = \frac{2\pi\sqrt{2}}{2 + \pi^2}\).
This result matches the argument of the inverse sine in the second term, \(\sin \phi\).
Consequently, \(\sin(2\theta) = \sin \phi\).
This equality implies that either \(\phi = 2\theta\) or \(\phi = \pi - 2\theta\), based on sine properties and inverse function ranges.
\(\phi\) is the principal value of \(\sin^{-1}\), so \(\phi \in [-\pi/2, \pi/2]\).
Since its argument \(\frac{2\sqrt{2}\pi}{2 + \pi^2}\) is positive, \(\phi\) lies in the interval \([0, \pi/2]\).
\(\theta = \cos^{-1} \sqrt{\frac{2}{2+\pi^2}}\) is in \([0, \pi/2]\) because the argument is positive and \(\cos^{-1}\) range is \([0, \pi]\).
Therefore, \(2\theta\) lies in the interval \([0, \pi]\).
Considering \(\sin(\phi) = \sin(2\theta)\) with \(\phi \in [0, \pi/2]\) and \(2\theta \in [0, \pi]\), the relationship is \(\phi = 2\theta\) if \(2\theta \le \pi/2\), and \(\phi = \pi - 2\theta\) if \(2\theta > \pi/2\).
The value of \(\theta = \cos^{-1} \sqrt{\frac{2}{2+\pi^{2}}}\) is used for numerical checking.
Let's think in parallel.

</Goal>
<Path>
1.1: The value of \(\theta\) is approximated by computing \(2 + \pi^2 \approx 11.8696\), then \(\sqrt{2 / (2 + \pi^2)} \approx 0.4106\). \(\theta = \arccos(0.4106)\) is approximately 1.13 radians (65 degrees). Consequently, \(2\theta\) is approximately 2.26 radians (130 degrees). Since \(2\theta \approx 130^\circ > 90^\circ\) and \(\phi = \arcsin(\sin(2\theta))\) with \(\phi \in [0, \pi/2]\), this implies \(\phi = \pi - 2\theta\), based on the identity \(\arcsin(\sin x) = \pi - x\) for \(x \in (\pi/2, \pi]\).
Numerically, with \(\theta \approx 1.13\) radians, \(2\theta\) is approximately 2.26 radians.
\(\sin(2\theta)\) is approximately \(\sin(2.26) \approx 0.802\).
</Path>
<Path>
1.2: The argument for \(\phi\) is \(\frac{2\sqrt{2}\pi}{2 + \pi^2}\). Using \(\pi \approx 3.14\), \(\sqrt{2} \approx 1.414\), and \(2 + \pi^2 \approx 11.8696\), the numerator \(2\sqrt{2}\pi\) is approximately \(8.885\). Dividing by \(11.8696\), the argument is approximately \(0.749\). This value differs from the initial approximation of \(\sin(2\theta) \approx 0.802\).
A more accurate calculation of \(\frac{2\sqrt{2}\pi}{2 + \pi^2}\) uses \(\pi \approx 3.1416\) and \(\sqrt{2} \approx 1.4142\).
Then \(2 + \pi^2\) remains approximately 11.8696.
The numerator \(2\sqrt{2}\pi\) is approximately \(2 \times 1.4142 \times 3.1416 \approx 8.8858\).
The argument is approximately \(8.8858 / 11.8696 \approx 0.7489\).
Thus, \(\sin(\phi) \approx 0.7489\), leading to \(\phi \approx \arcsin(0.7489) \approx 0.847\) radians (approximately 48.5 degrees).
</Path>
<Conclusion>
Numerical approximations show \(2\theta \approx 130^\circ\), suggesting \(\phi = \pi - 2\theta\); the calculated argument for \(\phi\) is approximately 0.7489, yielding \(\phi \approx 48.5^\circ\), confirming the relationship.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
For \(\theta = \arccos\sqrt{2/(2 + \pi^2)}\), the term \(\sqrt{2/(2 + \pi^2)}\) is approximated as \(\sqrt{2/11.8696} \approx \sqrt{0.1685} \approx 0.4106\).
This approximation yields \(\theta \approx \arccos(0.4106) \approx 1.147\) radians (65.7 degrees).
Consequently, \(2\theta \approx 2.294\) radians (131.4 degrees).
The sine of this angle is \(\sin(2\theta) \approx \sin(2.294) \approx \sin(131.4^\circ) \approx 0.749\).
This value of \(\sin(2\theta)\) matches the previously calculated \(\sin(\phi) \approx 0.7489\).
It is thus confirmed that \(\sin(\phi) = \sin(2\theta)\).
Since \(\phi \in [-\pi/2, \pi/2]\) and \(2\theta \approx 131.4^\circ\) lies in the second quadrant (\(2\theta > \pi/2\)), it follows that \(\phi\) must be \(\pi - 2\theta\).
Numerically, \(\pi - 2\theta \approx 3.1416 - 2.294 \approx 0.847\) radians (approximately 48.5 degrees), which is consistent with \(\arcsin(0.749)\).
The relationship \(\phi = \pi - 2\theta\) is established, allowing for substitution.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The third term is \(\psi = \tan^{-1}(\sqrt{2} / \pi)\). Letting \(\psi\) represent this term gives \(\tan \psi = \sqrt{2} / \pi \approx 0.45\), so \(\psi \approx \arctan(0.45) \approx 0.422\) radians (about 24.2 degrees). A relationship between \(\theta\) and \(\psi\) is sought, recalling that \(\theta = \arccos(\sqrt{2/(2 + \pi^2)})\). The connection between \(\theta\) and \(\psi\) is investigated.
One method involves considering a right triangle representation for \(\theta\).
If a right triangle has adjacent side \(\sqrt{2}\) and hypotenuse \(\sqrt{2 + \pi^2}\), corresponding to \(\cos(\theta) = \sqrt{2}/\sqrt{2 + \pi^2}\), the opposite side is \(\pi\).
For this triangle, \(\tan(\theta)\) equals \(\text{opposite} / \text{adjacent} = \pi / \sqrt{2}\).
The definition of the third term gives \(\tan(\psi) = \sqrt{2}/\pi\).
This expression for \(\tan(\psi)\) is the reciprocal of \(\tan(\theta)\).
The conditions \(\tan(\theta) = \pi / \sqrt{2}\) and \(\tan(\psi) = \sqrt{2}/\pi\) imply \(\tan(\psi) = \cot(\theta)\).
The condition \(\tan(\psi) = \cot(\theta)\) suggests \(\theta + \psi = \pi/2\), since \(\cot(\theta) = \tan(\pi/2 - \theta)\).
Given \(\tan(\psi) = \cot(\theta)\), and that both \(\psi\) (from \(\arctan\)) and \(\theta\) (from \(\arccos\) of a positive argument) are in \([0, \pi/2]\), it must hold that \(\psi = \pi/2 - \theta\).
This establishes the relation \(\psi = \pi/2 - \theta\), suitable for substitution.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The relationship \(\phi = \pi - 2\theta\) is established from \(\sin(2\theta) = \sin\phi\), considering principal value ranges and numerical checks showing \(2\theta > \pi/2\). The relationship \(\psi = \pi/2 - \theta\) is derived from \(\tan\theta = \pi/\sqrt{2}\) and \(\tan\psi = \sqrt{2}/\pi\), implying \(\tan\psi = \cot\theta\), with both angles in \([0, \pi/2]\).

That's the same as above.
So it checks out numerically!
Therefore, the answer is 3π/4.
Therefore, after a detailed process, recognizing the relationships between the inverse trigonometric functions and exploiting their connections (like θ and ψ being complementary, and φ being linked to θ via the double angle identity), we find that all terms simplify elegantly to 3π/4.
