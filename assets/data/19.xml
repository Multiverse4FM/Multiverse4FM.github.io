Okay, so I need to find the maximum value of the expression \(a \times \sqrt{b} \times \sqrt[3]{c} \times \sqrt[4]{d}\) given that \(36a + 4b + 4c + 3d = 25\).
All variables are positive real numbers.
Hmm, I remember that optimization problems like this can often be solved using methods like Lagrange multipliers or the AM-GM inequality.
Let me think which would be more straightforward here.
The expression we need to maximize has variables multiplied together with different roots, which make their exponents fractional.
Maybe I can rewrite the expression in terms of exponents to make it easier to apply AM-GM.
Let me try that.
First, let's express everything with exponents:
\(a \times \sqrt{b} \times \sqrt[3]{c} \times \sqrt[4]{d} = a \times b^{1/2} \times c^{1/3} \times d^{1/4}\).
So if I represent each term as exponents, maybe I can find a way to apply the AM-GM inequality appropriately.
The AM-GM inequality states that for positive real numbers, the arithmetic mean is at least the geometric mean, with equality when all the numbers are equal.
But in our case, the variables have different coefficients in the constraint equation.
Maybe I need to consider weights.
Alternatively, Lagrange multipliers might be a more direct approach.
Let me recall: if we have a function \(f(a, b, c, d)\) to maximize subject to a constraint \(g(a, b, c, d) = 25\), then we can set up the Lagrangian \(L = f(a,b,c,d) - \lambda(g(a,b,c,d) - 25)\) and take partial derivatives with respect to each variable, set them equal to zero, and solve the system.
Let's try that.
First, define the function to maximize:
Let's think in parallel.

<Conclusion>
The problem involves maximizing the function \(f(a, b, c, d) = a \cdot b^{1/2} \cdot c^{1/3} \cdot d^{1/4}\) under the constraint \(36a + 4b + 4c + 3d = 25\).
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So the Lagrangian is:
\(L = a \cdot b^{1/2} \cdot c^{1/3} \cdot d^{1/4} - \lambda(36a + 4b + 4c + 3d - 25)\).
Now, compute partial derivatives with respect to each variable and set them to zero:
1. Partial derivative with respect to a:
\(\frac{\partial L}{\partial a} = b^{1/2} \cdot c^{1/3} \cdot d^{1/4} - 36\lambda = 0\).
2. Partial derivative with respect to b:
\(\frac{\partial L}{\partial b} = a \cdot \frac{1}{2} b^{-1/2} \cdot c^{1/3} \cdot d^{1/4} - 4\lambda = 0\).
3. Partial derivative with respect to c:
\(\frac{\partial L}{\partial c} = a \cdot b^{1/2} \cdot \frac{1}{3} c^{-2/3} \cdot d^{1/4} - 4\lambda = 0\).
4. Partial derivative with respect to d:
\(\frac{\partial L}{\partial d} = a \cdot b^{1/2} \cdot c^{1/3} \cdot \frac{1}{4} d^{-3/4} - 3\lambda = 0\).
5. Partial derivative with respect to λ:
\(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda} = -(36a + 4b + 4c + 3d - 25) = 0\).
So now, I have five equations:

λ can be expressed as \(\frac{b^{1/2} c^{1/3} d^{1/4}}{36}\) from the first equation and as \(\frac{a}{8} b^{-1/2} c^{1/3} d^{1/4}\) from the second equation.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So setting equations 1 and 2 equal:
\(\frac{b^{1/2} c^{1/3} d^{1/4}}{36} = \frac{a}{8} b^{-1/2} c^{1/3} d^{1/4}\).
Multiply both sides by 36 to simplify:
\(b^{1/2} c^{1/3} d^{1/4} = \frac{36}{8} a b^{-1/2} c^{1/3} d^{1/4}\).
Simplify the coefficients: 36/8 = 4.5 = 9/2
\(b^{1/2} c^{1/3} d^{1/4} = (9/2)a b^{-1/2} c^{1/3} d^{1/4}\).
Dividing both sides by \(c^{1/3} d^{1/4}\), we get:
\(b^{1/2} = (9/2)a b^{-1/2}\).
Multiply both sides by \(b^{1/2}\):
\(b = (9/2)a\).
So from this, we have that \(b = (9/2)a\).

2: Similarly, let's take equation 1 and equation 3:

2.2: From equation 3: \(\lambda = \frac{a}{12} b^{1/2} c^{-2/3} d^{1/4}\).
</Path>
<Conclusion>
λ can be expressed as \(\frac{b^{1/2} c^{1/3} d^{1/4}}{36}\) from the first equation and as \(\frac{a}{12} b^{1/2} c^{-2/3} d^{1/4}\) from the third equation.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Set equal:
\(\frac{b^{1/2} c^{1/3} d^{1/4}}{36} = \frac{a}{12} b^{1/2} c^{-2/3} d^{1/4}\).
Multiply both sides by 36:
\(b^{1/2} c^{1/3} d^{1/4} = 3 a b^{1/2} c^{-2/3} d^{1/4}\).
Divide both sides by \(b^{1/2} d^{1/4}\):
\(c^{1/3} = 3a c^{-2/3}\).
Multiply both sides by \(c^{2/3}\):
\(c^{1/3 + 2/3} = 3a \implies c = 3a\).
Ok, so c = 3a.

<Path>
3: Similarly, use equation 1 and equation 4:
Let's think in parallel.

3.1: Express λ using the equation derived from the partial derivative with respect to 'a'.
</Outline>
<Outline>

3.1: From equation 1: λ = \( \frac{b^{1/2} c^{1/3} d^{1/4}}{36} \).
</Path>
<Path>
3.2: From equation 4: λ = \( \frac{a}{12} b^{1/2} c^{1/3} d^{-3/4} \).
</Path>
<Conclusion>
λ can be expressed as \( \frac{b^{1/2} c^{1/3} d^{1/4}}{36} \) from the first equation and as \( \frac{a}{12} b^{1/2} c^{1/3} d^{-3/4} \) from the fourth equation.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Setting them equal:
\(\frac{b^{1/2} c^{1/3} d^{1/4}}{36} = \frac{a}{12} b^{1/2} c^{1/3} d^{-3/4}\).
Cancel the common terms: \( b^{1/2} c^{1/3} \).
So we get:
\( \frac{d^{1/4}}{36} = \frac{a d^{-3/4}}{12} \).
Multiply both sides by 36:
\( d^{1/4} = \frac{36}{12} a d^{-3/4}\).
\( d^{1/4} = 3a d^{-3/4}\).
Multiply both sides by \(d^{3/4}\):
\( d^{1/4 + 3/4} = 3a \implies d = 3a \).
Hence, similar to before, we have d = 3a.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
By comparing the expressions for λ derived from the partial derivatives, we found the relationships between the variables at the maximum point: b = (9/2)a, c = 3a, and d = 3a.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So summarizing:
From comparing equations 1 and 2: b = (9/2) a.
From equations 1 and 3: c = 3a.
From equations 1 and 4: d = 3a.
So all variables are expressed in terms of a.
Now we can substitute these expressions into the constraint equation (equation 5):
\(36a + 4b + 4c + 3d =25\).
Substitute b, c, d:
36a + 4*(9/2)a + 4*(3a) + 3*(3a) =25.
Calculate each term:
36a + 4*(9/2)a = 36a + 18a = 54a.
Then 4*(3a) =12a.
3*(3a)=9a.
Total: 54a +12a +9a=75a.
So 75a =25
Therefore, a=25/75=1/3.
So a=1/3.
Then, substituting back, find the other variables:

</Path>
<Conclusion>
With a = 1/3, the calculated values for the other variables are b = 3/2, c = 1, and d = 1.

Therefore, the variables are:
a=1/3,
b=3/2,

<Path>
2: The value of the expression \(a \times \sqrt{b} \times \sqrt[3]{c} \times \sqrt[4]{d}\) is computed. Substituting the determined values, \(a=1/3, b=3/2, c=1, d=1\), into this expression gives \((1/3) \times \sqrt{3/2} \times \sqrt[3]{1} \times \sqrt[4]{1}\). Since \(\sqrt[3]{1}=1\) and \(\sqrt[4]{1}=1\), the expression can be simplified.
The simplified calculation is \((1/3) \times \sqrt{3/2} \times 1 \times 1\), which results in \((1/3)\sqrt{3/2}\).
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The determined values \(a=1/3, b=3/2, c=1, d=1\) satisfy the constraint equation \(36a + 4b + 4c + 3d = 25\), and the value of the objective expression \(a \times \sqrt{b} \times \sqrt[3]{c} \times \sqrt[4]{d}\) at these points is \((1/3)\sqrt{3/2}\).

Simplify sqrt(3/2):
sqrt(3)/sqrt(2) = √3 / √2 = √(3/2).
Alternatively, rationalize the denominator:
sqrt(3/2) = √6 / 2.
So (1/3)*(√6 / 2) = √6 /6.
Therefore, the maximum value is √6 /6.
Wait, let me check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.
Now compute the expression:
a =1/3,
sqrt(b)=sqrt(3/2)=sqrt(3)/sqrt(2),
sqrt[3]{c}=1,
sqrt[4]{d}=1.
Multiply all together:
(1/3)*(sqrt(3)/sqrt(2))*1*1= (sqrt(3)/3*sqrt(2)).
But sqrt(3)/3 is 1/sqrt(3).
So 1/(sqrt(3)*sqrt(2))=1/sqrt(6)=sqrt(6)/6.
Yes, that's right.
So rationalizing the denominator, it's sqrt(6)/6.
So the maximum value is sqrt(6)/6.
Therefore, the answer is \(\dfrac{\sqrt{6}}{6}\).
