Alright, so I need to figure out the lateral displacement of an electromagnetic wave that's being totally internally reflected. The setup is Medium#1 with n1 = 1.75 to Medium#2 with n2 = 1.26, and the angle of incidence is 80 degrees, which is more than the critical angle. The wavelength in Medium#1 is 400 nm. The answer choices are given, so I can check if my calculation matches one of them.
First, I recall that when light undergoes total internal reflection, there's a lateral displacement of the reflected beam known as the Goos-Hänchen shift. I need to calculate that.

Let's think in parallel.

1: Wait, but how exactly is this displacement calculated? I think the formula involves the wavelength and the angle of incidence, as well as the refractive indices. Let me try to remember. Maybe it's something like D = (λ / π) * (sin(i) / sqrt(n1^2 sin^2(i) - n2^2))? Hmm, I might be mixing up some parts here.
</Path>
<Path>
2: Let me check. The Goos-Hänchen shift for total internal reflection is given by D = (2 * λ1 * tan(i)) / (π * sqrt( (n1/n2)^2 * sin^2(i) - 1 )) ), where λ1 is the wavelength in the first medium. Wait, let me confirm that formula.
</Path>
<Path>
3: Alternatively, another source mentions that the lateral displacement is ( (2 * n1 * cos(i)) / ( sqrt( n1^2 sin^2(i) - n2^2 ) ) )) multiplied by ( λ / (2 * π) ). Hmm, this seems similar.
</Path>
<Path>
4: Wait, perhaps the Goos-Hänchen shift D is given by D = ( λ / (2π) ) * ( 2 sin(i) ) / sqrt( ( (n1 sin(i)/n2)^2 - 1 ) ). Let's try to piece together the formula.
</Path>
<Path>
5: Alternatively, if we consider the light to experience a phase shift upon total internal reflection, and the lateral displacement arises from this. The formula that comes to mind is D = (2 π δ)/k, where δ is the penetration depth, but I might be overcomplicating.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
Several potential formulas for the Goos-Hänchen shift have been recalled or considered, involving different trigonometric functions (sin, tan, cos) and constants. One formula relates the shift to the penetration depth. Further verification is needed to identify the correct formula.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Wait more carefully, maybe I should refer to the standard formula for the lateral displacement (also called the Goos-Hänchen shift) in total internal reflection. I think it is given by: D = (λ1 / π) * ( tan(i) / sqrt( ( (n1/n2)^2 * sin^2(i) ) - 1 ) ) where λ1 is the wavelength in the first medium, n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the first and second media, and i is the angle of incidence. But wait, one thing is the wavelength in medium 1, which is given as 400 nm. So λ1 = 400 nm. Substitute all the given values into this formula. So plugging in the numbers: n1 = 1.75, n2 = 1.26, i = 80 degrees, λ1 = 400 nm. First, compute (n1/n2)^2 * sin^2(i) - 1. But before that, let me make sure.

Let's think in parallel.

<Outline>
1: Verify that the condition for Total Internal Reflection (TIR) is met by calculating the critical angle and comparing it to the angle of incidence.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: Wait another approach: if the critical angle i0 is given by arcsin(n2/n1). Let's verify if 80 degrees is indeed greater than i0. So compute i0 = arcsin(n2 / n1) = arcsin(1.26 / 1.75). Let me compute 1.26 divided by 1.75: 1.26 / 1.75 ≈ 0.72. So arcsin(0.72) ≈ 46 degrees (since sin(45) ≈ 0.7071, sin(46°) ≈ 0.7193, so approx 46 degrees). So yes, 80 degrees is greater than the critical angle ~46 degrees. Thus, we do have total internal reflection, and lateral displacement (Goos-Hänchen shift) occurs.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The calculation confirmed that the angle of incidence (80 degrees) is greater than the critical angle (approximately 46 degrees), so Total Internal Reflection and the Goos-Hänchen shift will occur.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So returning to the formula. The standard formula for lateral displacement in total internal reflection is: D = (λ1 / (2π)) * ( 2 * tan(i) ) / sqrt( (n1/n2)^2 * sin^2(i) - 1 ) Wait, maybe. Alternatively, according to Born and Wolf's Principles of Optics, the lateral displacement is given by: D = ( 2 * n2 * sin(i) * d ) / ( sqrt(n1^2 sin^2(i) - n2^2) ) ) But where d is the penetration depth, which is ( λ / (2π) ) * ( n2 / sqrt(n1^2 sin^2(i) - n2^2) ) Wait, combining these, D = 2 * n2 * sin(i) * (λ / (2π)) * n2 / sqrt(...) * ... Hmm, maybe this is leading me astray. Alternatively, the formula for Goos-Hänchen shift D can be expressed as: D = ( λ / (2π) ) * [ 2 sin(i) / sqrt( sin^2(i) - (n2/n1)^2 ) ] Wait, perhaps. Let me check a reference.
Actually, according to some sources, the Goos-Hänchen shift for s-polarization (TE) and p-polarization (TM) are different. In this problem, the wave is plane-polarized parallel to the interface. Wait, the problem says "plane-polarized parallel to the interface", which would be TE polarization (electric field perpendicular to the plane of incidence, i.e., parallel to the interface). Analyze the phrase "parallel to the interface". But actually, the term can be ambiguous. Wait: when the polarization is parallel to the interface, that could mean TE polarization (electric field perpendicular to the plane of incidence, hence parallel to the interface), or sometimes people refer to p-polarization as parallel. Wait, maybe the user is using it as TE polarization. But the formula for Goos-Hänchen shift does depend a bit on the polarization. Hmm. Wait, in the original Goos-Hänchen effect, the shift is different for TE and TM. Alternatively, the formula might be the same for both polarizations? Wait, no. Let me check: For TE polarization (electric field perpendicular to the plane of incidence), the Goos-Hänchen shift D_TE is given by: D_TE = ( λ / π ) * ( tanθ ) / sqrt( (n1^2/n2^2) sin^2θ - 1 ) For TM polarization (electric field in the plane of incidence), the shift D_TM is larger, but in this problem, the polarization is parallel to the interface (so TE), so we have to use TE formula. Wait, but maybe I should verify whether "parallel to the interface" here refers to the electric field being TE (perpendicular to the plane of incidence, hence parallel to the interface) or parallel. The problem states the wave is "plane-polarized parallel to the interface". So, the electric field is oscillating in a plane parallel to the interface. Hmm. Let me parse this carefully. Incident wave is plane-polarized parallel to the interface. In standard terms, the plane of polarization is defined by the direction of propagation and the electric field. So, if the wave is incident in the plane of incidence (the plane containing the incident ray and the normal), then if the electric field is in that plane, it's p-polarized. If it's perpendicular, it's s-polarized. But in this case, the interface is a plane. If the polarization is parallel to the interface, then it's TE polarization, because TE (s-polarized) has the electric field perpendicular to the plane of incidence (and hence parallel to the interface). Whereas TM (p-polarized) has the electric field in the plane of incidence. So likely in this problem, "plane-polarized parallel to the interface" refers to TE polarization (s-polarization). Therefore, the formula for D_TE applies. So using the formula for TE polarization, the Goos-Hänchen shift is: D_TE = (λ1 / π) * [ tan(i) / sqrt( (n1^2 / n2^2) * sin^2(i) - 1 ) ] Where λ1 is the wavelength in the first medium.
So let's compute this step by step.

Let's think in parallel.

</Goal>
<Path>
1: First, compute (n1 / n2)^2: n1 = 1.75, n2 = 1.26. (n1 / n2) = 1.75 / 1.26 ≈ 1.3889. Squared: (1.3889)^2 ≈ 1.929. Then compute (n1 / n2)^2 * sin^2(i): First, sin(80°). sin(80°) ≈ 0.9848. So squared: (0.9848)^2 ≈ 0.9698. Multiply by 1.929: 1.929 * 0.9698 ≈ 1.871. Subtracting 1, we have sqrt(1.871 - 1) = sqrt(0.871) ≈ 0.9333.
</Path>
<Path>
2: Then take tan(80°). tan(80°) ≈ 5.671.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The calculation yielded the square root term in the denominator as approximately 0.9333 and the tangent of the angle of incidence as approximately 5.671.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Now, divide tan(i) by the sqrt value: 5.671 / 0.9333 ≈ 6.077. Multiply by λ1 / π. λ1 is 400 nm. So D_TE ≈ (400 / π) * 6.077 ≈ (400 * 6.077) / 3.1416 ≈ (2430.8) / 3.1416 ≈ approximately 774 nm.
Wait, but this result isn't among the answer choices. The options are 75, 134, 162, 186 nm. Hmm. Therefore, there must be a mistake here. I must have used an incorrect formula. Wait a minute, 774 nm is way larger than the given options. Clearly, something is wrong here. Let's check my formula.

2: Wait, perhaps I used the formula for the beam shift in a different context. Alternatively, maybe the formula is actually different. Wait, another approach. Lateral displacement (D) can be calculated using D = (2 * t) / sin(2θ), where t is the thickness of the medium. Wait, but no, this is for other effects. Alternatively, I found an alternative formula for the Goos-Hänchen shift which is: D = (λ / (2π)) * ( (2 sin(i)) / sqrt( (sin(i))^2 - (n2/n1)^2 ) ) But wait, perhaps this formula? Wait, perhaps I have to derive it. The Goos-Hänchen shift occurs because the total internal reflection doesn't happen exactly at the interface but the beam penetrates slightly into the second medium before reflecting. This creates a phase shift, leading to a displacement. The formula is given as D = (2 * tanθ) / k1_z, where k1_z is the component of the wave vector in the z-direction (perpendicular to the interface). For evanescent waves, k1_z becomes imaginary, so D = (2 tanθ) / |k1_z|. But since k1_z = n1 k0 cosθ, where k0 = 2π/λ0. Wait, but let me think in terms of the wavelength in medium 1. Wait, λ1 = λ0 / n1, so k1 = 2πn1 / λ0. Wait, actually, the wave number in medium 1 is k1 = 2πn1 / λ0, where λ0 is the vacuum wavelength. But since in this problem, the wavelength in medium 1 is given as λ = 400 nm, that is λ1 = λ0 / n1 => λ0 = n1 * λ1. Therefore, the wave number k1 = 2π / λ1. But considering the evanescent wave in medium 2, the wave vector in medium 2 would have components (k2_x, k2_z). However, when we have total internal reflection, k2_z becomes imaginary. The penetration depth is related to 1 / Im(k2_z). But maybe this is getting too involved. Alternatively, perhaps there is a simpler expression for the lateral shift in terms of the Fresnel coefficients. The phase shift upon total internal reflection is different for TE and TM polarizations, and this phase shift leads to the lateral displacement. The lateral displacement D can be calculated as the derivative of the phase shift with respect to the wave number component parallel to the interface. Mathematically, D = (1 / k_x) * dφ/dk_x, where φ is the phase shift upon reflection. Wait, since this is getting too technical and I need a more straightforward approach, given that the answer is not matching the options. Maybe the formula I used is incorrect. Alternatively, check another formula.

3: According to some resources, the Goos-Hänchen shift can be expressed as: D = 2 * (n1 * sinθ)^2 * λ1 / ( 2π * sqrt( (n1 * sinθ)^2 - n2^2 ) ) Wait, this might give another result. Let's compute it.

Intermediate terms calculated: (n1*sinθ)^2 ≈ 2.97, n2^2 = 1.5876, and the square root term sqrt((n1*sinθ)^2 - n2^2) ≈ 1.1756.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So plug into D = ( 2 * 2.97 * 400 nm ) / ( 2 * π * 1.1756 ) Wait, let's compute numerator: 2 * 2.97 * 400 = 2 * 2.97 is 5.94, 5.94 * 400 ≈ 2376 nm. Denominator: 2 * π * 1.1756 ≈ 7.389. Then D ≈ 2376 / 7.389 ≈ 321.3 nm. Still not matching. This can't be right either. But both attempts give results way off the given answer choices. Therefore, there must be an error in my approach.
</Path>
<Path>
4: Wait, another formula found on the web: the lateral shift (Goos-Hänchen shift) is D = ( (2 * λ1) / (2π) ) * ( tanθ / sqrt( (n1 sinθ / n2)^2 - 1 ) ) Which simplifies to (λ1 / π) * ( tanθ / sqrt( ( (n1 sinθ)^2 / n2^2 ) - 1 ) ) Let's try this. So compute:

4.2: Then subtract 1: 1.872 - 1 = 0.872. sqrt(0.872) ≈ 0.934.

<Conclusion>
Calculated intermediate terms: (n1 sinθ / n2)^2 ≈ 1.872, the square root term sqrt(...) ≈ 0.934, and tan(80°) ≈ 5.671.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So D = (400 nm / π) * (5.671 / 0.934) ≈ (400 / 3.1416) * (6.073) ≈ (127.323) * 6.073 ≈ 773.7 nm Same as before. Still not matching the options. I must be missing something. Wait, perhaps I've mixed up the formula. Check another reference. For example, the formula for the Goos-Hänchen shift may depend on the polarization. Wait, indeed, for TE polarization, the phase shift φ is: φ = -2 arctan( sqrt( (n1^2 sin^2θ - n2^2 ) / (n1^2 cos^2θ) ) ) ) The lateral displacement is given by D = (dφ/dk)/cosθ, where k is the wave number in the first medium. But this requires differentiating the phase shift with respect to k, perhaps leading to a complicated expression. However, another approach relates the lateral shift to the angle of incidence and the penetration depth.
</Path>
<Path>
5: Try Penetration Depth Approach (D = 2 * δ * tanθ). The penetration depth κ is given by κ = λ1 / (2π sqrt( n1^2 sin^2θ - n2^2 )) ) Then the Goos-Hänchen shift would be 2 κ tanθ. So D = 2 * (λ1 / (2π sqrt( n1^2 sin^2θ - n2^2 ))) * tanθ ) Which simplifies to D = ( λ1 tanθ ) / ( π sqrt( n1^2 sin^2θ - n2^2 ) ) Which is indeed the same formula as before. Therefore, the D = (400 nm * tan(80°) ) / ( π sqrt( (1.75^2 sin^2(80°) ) - 1.26^2 ) ) Compute this step-by-step: Compute the denominator first. n1 = 1.75, n2 = 1.26, so n1^2 = 3.0625, n2^2 = 1.5876. sin(80°) ≈ 0.9848, so sin^2(80°) ≈ 0.9698. Multiply n1^2 by sin^2(theta): 3.0625 * 0.9698 ≈ 2.967 Subtract n2^2: 2.967 - 1.5876 = 1.3794 sqrt(1.3794) ≈ 1.1745 Then tan(80°) ≈ 5.671. So D = (400 * 5.671) / ( π * 1.1745 ) ≈ (2268.4) / (3.1416 * 1.1745) ≈ 2268.4 / 3.691 ≈ 614.5 nm Again, not matching options. All these calculations are leading to numbers way higher than answer choices. The answer choices are 75-186 nm, so something is definitely wrong in my approach. Wait, maybe the formula is being considered for the case of metals, leading to a different shift. But no, the problem is dielectric to dielectric. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the lateral displacement of the ray upon reflection due to the finite width of the beam, leading to a geometric displacement. But that would be negligible, or... Wait. Alternatively, another thought: When light undergoes total internal reflection, sometimes people assume that the reflection is instantaneous, so no lateral shift. But in reality, due to the evanescent wave, there is a shift. However, some textbooks approximate this shift as: D = ( 2 t ) where t is the penetration depth multiplied by the sine of the angle? Wait, no. Wait, penetration depth δ is typically given by δ = λ1 / (2π sqrt(n1^2 sin^2θ - n2^2)) But the lateral displacement might be approximated as D = 2 δ tanθ Let me calculate that. First, compute δ. Given: λ1 = 400 nm sqrt(n1^2 sin^2theta - n2^2) = sqrt(1.75^2 * sin^280° - 1.26^2 ) ≈ sqrt(3.0625 * 0.9698 - 1.5876) ≈ sqrt(2.967 - 1.5876) ≈ sqrt(1.3794) ≈ 1.1745 Therefore, δ = 400 nm / (2π * 1.1745) ≈ 400 / (7.383) ≈ 54.18 nm So D = 2 * δ * tanθ ≈ 2 * 54.18 * 5.671 ≈ 108.36 * 5.671 ≈ 613 nm, which is the same as before. Not matching answer choices. So unless they use a different formula, but maybe the formula they use is D = ( λ / 2 ) * ( sin(2i) / sqrt( (n1/n2)^2 - 1 ) ) Wait, another possibility. Since the answer options are all in the 100-nm range when calculated, but perhaps I made an error in consideration of refractive indices. Wait, let's check critical angle again: Given n1=1.75, n2=1.26, so critical angle is arcsin(n2/n1) = arcsin(1.26 / 1.75) ≈ arcsin(0.72) ≈ 46 degrees as before. Since angle i=80 degrees > 46 degrees, so TIR occurs. Alternatively, if there's a phase shift upon reflection that translates to a displacement. Maybe an approximate formula exists. Wait, let's consider the geometrical interpretation. If the beam penetrates a small distance into medium 2 before reflecting, then the lateral displacement D can be approximated as 2d tanθ, where d is the effective depth. But how to get d. If the wave penetrates a small distance, the depth is about a wavelength. But according to the penetration depth formula, which is δ ≈ λ / (2π sqrt(n1^2 sin^2θ - n2^2)) Wait. But from previous calculations, δ≈54 nm. So D=2*54*5.671≈613 nm. So still large. The formula must not be appropriate. Wait, maybe the problem is actually not about Goos-Hänchen shift but about something else. Wait, the question says "lateral displacement of the beam while getting reflected". Maybe this refers to the Displacement Current or something else. Wait, not sure.

<Path>
6: Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply using the formula D = ( λ / (2) ) * ( sin(2i) / sqrt( ( (n1 sin i)/n2 )^2 -1 ) ) Let me try that. So D = (400 / 2) * sin(160°) / sqrt( ( (1.75 * 0.9848)/1.26 )^2 - 1 )

So D = 200 * 0.3420 / 0.934 ≈ 68.4 / 0.934 ≈73.27 nm. Close to option A:75.39 nm. Hmmm. Not exactly though. Wait, the angle given is 80 degrees, which is the angle of incidence. Then sin(2i) is sin(160°)=0.3420. So using this in the equation. But where did I get this formula? Honestly, I'm making this up based on some term that gives a number close to the answer. But maybe another source defines the lateral displacement differently. Is this possible?

n1/n2=1.388, squared=1.928, sin^2(i)=0.9698. Multiply: 1.928*0.9698≈1.870. Subtract 1 to get 0.870. sqrt≈0.933. Therefore: D=(400/3.1416)*(0.9848/0.933)≈(127.32)*(1.055)≈134.4 nm. Ah! That's option B. So 134.56 nm, which is option B. Let me check the steps again.

9: According to Section 19.4 in Ghatak's Optics, the lateral shift for a TE wave is D = ( lambda / pi ) * [ sin(theta) / sqrt{ ( sin^2(theta) - sin^2(theta_c) ) } ] , where theta_c is the critical angle. Computing D: But theta_c = arcsin(n2/n1) = arcsin(1.26/1.75)≈46 degrees.

Original calculation was sqrt(0.9698 - 0.7193) = sqrt(0.2505)=0.5. Using sin(46 deg) approx 0.7193. sin^2(46 deg) approx 0.5174. Let's use 0.5 from the original calculation for now.

Thus, D= (400 / π) * (0.9848/0.5)= (400 * 0.9848 *2 ) / π≈ (787.84)/3.1416≈250.8 nm. Still not matching. Hmmm. Alternatively, formula in Ghatak's book p. 381: the lateral displacement s is given by: s = ( 2 sin(theta) ) / ( beta * sqrt(1 + (epsilon1/epsilon2) ) ), where beta is given by... the imaginary part of the wave number in the second medium. But it's too involved without exact definitions. Alternatively, consider the problem may take into account that the wavelength in medium2 is lambda2 = lambda1 *n1/n2. But not sure if it affects. Thinking back, since option B can be achieved by using sin(theta) instead of tan(theta), maybe there's an error in the formula used. Wait, here's a link to a research paper or educational resource: Goos-Hänchen shift formula for TE polarization is D = (2 k0 )^{-1} \cdot [ 2 \tan(theta) \cdot Re( \epsilon1 / ( \sqrt{ \epsilon1 \sin^2(theta) - \epsilon2 } ) ) ] But too complicated. Wait another thought. The wave's effective path when undergoing TIR is longer, leading to a phase shift. The lateral displacement is estimated using D= lambda/(2 pi n1) * delta. But what is delta here. Alternatively, consider that the formula uses wavelengths in medium1. The original wavelength in medium1 is 400 nm. Let's see: Given the penetration depth κ = λ1/(2 pi sqrt(n1^2 sind^2(theta) -n2^2)) ) Then displacement D=2 kappa tan(theta), which was D= (400)/(2 pi sqrt(1.3794)) * 5.671 ≈56.84 *5.671≈322 nm. Not matching。 Another resource suggests: D = (2 tan(theta) * lambda)/(pi * sqrt( (n1 sin theta / n2)^2 -1 )). So substituting that: D=(2*5.671*400)/(3.1416*sqrt(1.871 -1))≈ (4536.8 )/( 3.1416*0.933)≈4536.8/2.933≈1546 nm. Nope, way too high. Wait this is frustrating. The answer is supposed to be one of the given options. After multiple approaches not getting the desired result, but substituting using sin(theta) instead of tan(theta) gave answer B. Given that, perhaps the original formula should use sin(theta) instead of tan(theta). However, no theoretical basis provided. Alternatively, maybe the calculation takes into account 2 passes (entering and exiting the medium), thereby halving the distance. If we divided by 2π somewhere, but still. Alternatively, I might be missing a factor. Wait, let's start over with another approach. The phase shift φ upon reflection for TE polarization is given by φ= -2 arctan( sqrt( (n12 sin2θ -n22)/n12 cos2θ ) ) The lateral displacement D is equal to (1/k) * dφ/dθ / cosθ (maybe as per derivation on Wikipedia). Let's compute: First, compute dφ/dθ : Let’s define A= sqrt( (n12 sin2θ -n22)/(n12 cos2θ)) ). Then, φ= -2 arctan(A). Let’s differentiate φ with respect to theta: dφ/d theta = -2 * [ 1/(1+A2) ] * dA/d theta First, compute A: A= sqrt( (n12 sin2θ -n22)/n12 cos2θ ) = sqrt( (n12 sin2θ -n22)/(n12 cos2θ) ) = sqrt( (n12 (1 - cos2θ)/n12 -n22/n1^2 ) / cos2θ ) Not sure if this helps. Alternatively, compute derivative. Let me denote u = (n12 sin2θ -n22) v= n12 cos2θ So A= sqrt(u/v) Thus, dA/dθ = (1/(2 sqrt(u/v))) * ( (v du/dθ - u dv/dθ ) / v2 ) Which is complicated. Maybe it's easier to use symbolic differentiation. However, perhaps beyond the time I can commit here. Given that the options include 134.56 nm as B, and it matches the calculation where D=( λ1 / π ) * [ sintheta / sqrt( (n1/n2)^2 sin^2theta -1 ) ]. Even though I'm conflicting with the expected formula containing tantheta, there's a possibility the problem uses this formula. Therefore, perhaps option B is correct. Another line of thought: My earlier result using D= ( λ1 /π ) * [ sintheta / sqrt( (n1/n2 )**2 sin^2theta -1 ) ] =134.5 nm. That matches answer B. Perhaps this is meant to be calculated using that expression. Despite the prior references implying tan(theta), this problem uses sin(theta).

1: But wait: why would the formula be D=(λ1/π)* [ sin(i) / sqrt(...) ] If that's the case, then: D=(400 / π) * [ sin(80) / sqrt( (n1/n2)^2 sin^2(80) -1 ) ] So: n1/n2=1.75/1.26≈1.388. (n1/n2)^2≈1.928. Multiply by sin^2(80)=0.9698≈1.870. Subtract 1 to get 0.870. sqrt(0.870)≈0.933. Therefore: D=(400/3.1416)*(0.9848/0.933)≈(127.32)*(1.055)≈134.4 nm. Which matches option B. But why does the formula use sin(i) and not tan(i)? That seems inconsistent with the prior formulas that I've seen. However, substituting the numbers into this formula gives an answer that's in the given options. Therefore, perhaps this is the formula that's supposed to be used here, even though the standard Goos-Hänchen shift formulas that I previously recall use tan(theta). Wait, but that discrepancy is confusing. Maybe different derivations for different polarizations? Alternatively, perhaps a variation in the shift. Let me think. The standard expression is that for TE polarization the lateral shift is D = (λ / π ) * [ tan(theta) / sqrt( (n1/n2)^2 sin^2(theta) -1 ) ] as before, but here, substituting the numbers gives 773 nm which is not one of the options. However, if the formula instead uses sin(theta) instead of tan(theta), then it would give ≈ 134 nm, which fits option B. Therefore, it's possible that I have mixed up polarizations. Maybe in TE polarization, the formula uses tan(theta) and in TM uses sin(theta) or something. Or perhaps even vice versa. Wait, but since the problem states the wave is plane-polarized parallel to the interface (TE polarization), then I would think we use the TE formula. However, if using the formula with sin(theta), it gives the answer option B. But then what's different about this formula? Maybe the user is utilizing an approximate version of the shift? Alternatively, another possible root: for large angles (theta >> critical angle), tan(theta) can be written as approximately sin(theta)/cos(theta). But if that term is involved in the denominator from another variable. Wait. But given that option B is there, and using this formula gives 134.5nm, which is answer B. Perhaps the problem had a different derivation. If I refer to some other resource, e.g., Ajoy Ghatak's Optics, there's a formula.

2: Evaluate the physical basis/justification for the Alt Interpretation D_perp = D_GH * cos(i). So, let's verify: If the lateral displacement along the direction parallel to the interface (i.e., perpendicular to the beam direction) is computed, then the formula would be D_perp= D * cos(theta). Where does this come from? The Goos-Hänchen shift D is along the direction of propagation (i.e., parallel to the surface), and the question might be asking for the lateral displacement perpendicular to the beam direction. However, typically, lateral displacement as D is parallel to the interface, so why resolve it? Wait, need to clarify coordinate system. Upon reflection, the beam exits displaced parallel to the interface. The beam's direction of propagation after reflection is mirror-symmetric with respect to the original, but the shift is in the plane of incidence along the interface. So, if your interface is at the x-y plane and the beam is incident in the x-z plane, the lateral shift D is along the x-axis. Alternatively, if the light is p-polarized, there might be different effects, but the displacement is still parallel to the interface. However, in this question, given that it's TE polarization. Thus, D remains parallel to the interface. If the original calculation gives D≈773 nm along the interface. However, if the problem defines lateral displacement as the vertical displacement (perpendicular to the interface), which is highly unlikely, you would have t= depth, but displacement vertically is zero, as beam is reflected. Therefore, it's contradictory. Maybe the beam is coming in at 80 degrees, so the path for the Goos-Hänchen shift is longer. But wait, the user refers to lateral displacement meaning the beam shifts sideways upon reflection. In real terms, when you shine a beam at an angle higher than critical angle, it reflects but shifted sideways along the direction of incidence. But, according to our calculations using the GH shift formula with tan(theta), getting D≈773 nm, but options given are 134.56 nm. But when considering the projection of GH shift along the direction perpendicular to the original beam. Wait, GH shift D is in the plane of the interface and parallel to it, as the movement along the interface when entering and exiting the second medium. Therefore, if the incident beam is propagating in the plane at incidence angle i, then the GH displacement is along the interface. When projected onto a plane perpendicular to the incident beam direction, that displacement is D_beam = D / cos(i). While D along the interface is D. Wait, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe the given answer uses the formula for Brewster's angle or something else. Alternatively, perhaps using the geometric path due to beam reflection. Wait, considering geometric displacement.If a beam hits a mirror, displacement would not exist. But here with TIR, there's a displacement. But for some reason maybe calculated differently. For example, assuming the penetration depth is delta, and the lateral displacement is delta / cos(theta) or delta sin(theta). For penetration depth 54 nm, so: If penetration depth delta ≈54 nm, then lateral displacement during round trip (penetrate and come back hence 2*delta), and horizontal component. But in that case, total displacement would be 2* delta tan(theta) ≈2*54*5.671≈613 nm, which is again not in the options. However, 54*0.9848= ~53.3 nm, lateral direction, not.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The formula D ~ sin(i) / sqrt(...) lacks clear theoretical justification compared to standard formulas using tan(i), but it numerically matches option B. The interpretation D_perp = D_GH * cos(i) also matches option B numerically, but its physical basis is questionable as the Goos-Hänchen shift is typically defined parallel to the interface. The projection D / cos(i) perpendicular to the beam direction was also considered but leads to confusion. Standard penetration depth relations don't yield the correct result either. Both successful approaches lack strong theoretical backing.

Conclude reasoning and select final answer. At this point, after crunching all scenarios, the only way to get an answer as per the given options is via taking D= (lambda/pi)*(sintheta/sqrt(... )), leading to 134.NM. My earlier result using D= ( λ1 /π ) * [ sintheta / sqrt( (n1/n2 )**2 sin^2theta -1 ) ] =134.5 nm. But taking D=773 nm, then D_perp=773 * cos(80)= 773 *0.1736≈134.5 nm. That seems inconsistent with the prior formulas that I've seen. Since this matches option B,and given that I don't have access to the specific formula the problem assumes, given the time invested, i'll opt for B.
