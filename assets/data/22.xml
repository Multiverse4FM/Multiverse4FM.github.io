Alright, so I have this vector problem here, and I need to find the maximum value of the expression:
$\|\mathbf{a} - 2 \mathbf{b}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{b} - 2 \mathbf{c}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a}\|^2$.
Given that $\|\mathbf{a}\| = \|\mathbf{b}\| = 1$ and $\|\mathbf{c}\| = 2$.
Hmm, okay.
Let me try to break this down step by step.
First, I recall that the squared norm of a vector difference can be expanded using the formula $\|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}\|^2 = \|\mathbf{x}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{y}\|^2 - 2\mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{y}$.
That should help me expand each term here.
Expand each squared norm term and substitute norms.
Let's think in parallel.

1: Starting with the first term: $\|\mathbf{a} - 2 \mathbf{b}\|^2$.
Applying the formula, that would be $\|\mathbf{a}\|^2 + (2)^2\|\mathbf{b}\|^2 - 2 \times \mathbf{a} \cdot (2\mathbf{b})$.
Since $\|\mathbf{a}\| = 1$ and $\|\mathbf{b}\| = 1$, this becomes:
$1^2 + 4 \times 1^2 - 2 \times 2 \times (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}) = 1 + 4 - 4(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}) = 5 - 4\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}$.
Okay, so the first term simplifies to 5 minus 4 times the dot product of a and b.
</Path>
<Path>
2: Moving on to the second term: $\|\mathbf{b} - 2 \mathbf{c}\|^2$.
Again, using the formula, that's $\|\mathbf{b}\|^2 + (2)^2\|\mathbf{c}\|^2 - 2 \times \mathbf{b} \cdot (2\mathbf{c})$.
Given $\|\mathbf{b}\| = 1$ and $\|\mathbf{c}\| = 2$, this is:
$1 + 4 \times 4 - 4(\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c}) = 1 + 16 - 4(\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c}) = 17 - 4\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c}$.
Got it, so the second term is 17 minus 4 times the dot product of b and c.
</Path>
<Path>
3: Third term: $\|\mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a}\|^2$.
Expand that to $\|\mathbf{c}\|^2 + (2)^2\|\mathbf{a}\|^2 - 2 \times \mathbf{c} \cdot (2\mathbf{a})$.
With $\|\mathbf{c}\| = 2$ and $\|\mathbf{a}\| = 1$, it becomes:
$4 + 4 \times 1 - 4(\mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a}) = 4 + 4 - 4(\mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a}) = 8 - 4\mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a}$.
So, the third term is 8 minus 4 times the dot product of c and a.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The first term simplifies to $5 - 4\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}$. The second term simplifies to $17 - 4\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c}$. The third term simplifies to $8 - 4\mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a}$.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Simplify the total expanded expression.
Now, putting all three expanded terms together, the entire expression becomes:
$[5 - 4\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}] + [17 - 4\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c}] + [8 - 4\mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a}]$.
Let me compute the constants first: 5 + 17 + 8 = 30.
Then, the terms with the dot products: $-4\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} -4\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} -4\mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a}$.
Factor out the -4, so it's $-4(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a})$.
Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to $30 - 4(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a})$.
So, to maximize the original expression, we need to minimize the sum of the dot products: $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a}$.
Therefore, the problem reduces to minimizing $S = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a}$ given the constraints on the magnitudes of the vectors.
Given that all vectors are in some inner product space (probably real vectors in Euclidean space), with $\|\mathbf{a}\| = \|\mathbf{b}\| = 1$, and $\|\mathbf{c}\| = 2$.
Express S using magnitudes and cosines.
So, what do we know about dot products? Well, the dot product of two vectors is equal to the product of their magnitudes times the cosine of the angle between them: $\mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{y} = \|\mathbf{x}\| \|\mathbf{y}\| \cos \theta_{xy}$.
Thus, the dot product terms can be expressed in terms of angles:

<Conclusion>
The resulting expressions for the dot products are $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \cos \theta_{ab}$, $\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} = 2 \cos \theta_{bc}$, and $\mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a} = 2 \cos \theta_{ca}$.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So, $S = \cos \theta_{ab} + 2 \cos \theta_{bc} + 2 \cos \theta_{ca}$
Therefore, we need to minimize $S = \cos \theta_{ab} + 2 \cos \theta_{bc} + 2 \cos \theta_{ca}$
So, our variables here are the three angles θ_ab, θ_bc, and θ_ca. However, angles aren't independent because vectors a, b, c presumably can be related in 3D space. Therefore, these angles are constrained by the geometric relations between the vectors.
Alternatively, maybe I can treat the vectors a, b, c as arbitrary vectors in some space (maybe 3D or higher) with the given norms, and need to minimize that sum of dot products. Alternatively, perhaps fix some coordinate system and express the vectors in terms of coordinates. Hmm.
Alternatively, maybe we can introduce Lagrange multipliers, as the problem is to minimize a linear combination of dot products with constraints on the magnitudes of the vectors.
But coordinate systems might complicate things. Alternatively, note that a, b, c can be elements of any real inner product space (so like any Euclidean space, with however many dimensions needed). So perhaps, without loss of generality, variables can be analyzed in higher-dimensional space but our key variables are those dot products.
However, maybe constraints between the angles due to the triangle inequality or other relations. Wait, vectors aren't necessarily in a plane or anything. So unless in 3D, perhaps the angles can be arbitrary? But actually, even in higher dimensions, sets of vectors can have angles that are independent, as embedding requires only certain conditions.
But is there a relation between θ_{ab}, θ_{bc}, θ_{ca}? Suppose that θ1 = θ_ab, θ2 = θ_bc, θ3 = θ_ca.
Wait, perhaps using a coordinate system where vector a is, say, along the x-axis - that can simplify the problem?
Alternatively, perhaps use the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the minimal value of S given the constraints on the norms. Let me try to formalize this.
Let $x = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = cosθ_ab$,
$y = \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} = 2 cosθ_bc$,
$z = \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a} = 2 cosθ_ca$,
But wait no: The magnitudes are given, so $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = ||a|| ||b|| cosθ_ab = 1*1*cosθ_ab = cosθ_ab$,
Similarly, $\mathbf{b} \cdot\mathbf{c} = ||b|| ||c|| cosθ_bc = 1*2*cosθ_bc = 2 cosθ_bc$,
Similarly, $\mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a} = ||c|| ||a|| cosθ_ca = 2*1 cosθ_ca = 2 cosθ_ca$,
Therefore, $S = x + y + z$, where:
$x = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}$,
$y = \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c}$,
$z = \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a}$,
But need to note that x, y, z are not independent. For example, if we consider the angle between a and b, between b and c, and between a and c, but these are angles in 3D space. So perhaps you can choose some coordinates to represent the vectors such that some angles are aligned, maybe?
Alternatively, think about variables: Let’s fix a coordinate system where:
Let’s set vector a to point along the x-axis. So,
a = (1, 0, 0)
Then, vector b is some unit vector, which we can write in spherical coordinates as:
b = (cosφ, sinφ, 0), assuming it's in the xy-plane, for simplicity. Wait, but perhaps we can set φ=0 and make the vectors 3D.
Wait, but maybe thinking in terms of angles can complicate things. Maybe instead express variables and use Lagrange multipliers.
Set up Lagrangian and compute gradients.
The function to minimize is $S = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a}$,
Subject to the constraints:
$||a||^2 = 1$,
$||b||^2 = 1$,
$||c||^2 = 4$.
Set up Lagrangian:
$L = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a} + λ1(1 - ||a||^2) + λ2(1 - ||b||^2) + λ3(4 - ||c||^2)$.
Wait, but wait, Lagrange multipliers for maximization or minimization. Since I need to minimize S, which in terms of the original problem translates since the Original expression is 30 -4S, so maximizing that expression corresponds to minimizing S.
But here I need to set up the Lagrangian to find the minimum of S.
But maybe need some care.
Alternatively, take the gradient in terms of vectors.
Given $L = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a} + λ1(1 - \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a}) + λ2(1 - \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b}) + λ3(4 - \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{c})$
Then, taking the derivative with respect to vector a, set to zero:

</Parallel>
Solve the system from setting gradients to zero.
Therefore, the gradient conditions give:
1. $\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c} = 2λ1 \mathbf{a}$
2. $\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{c} = 2λ2 \mathbf{b}$
3. $\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} = 2λ3 \mathbf{c}$
And the constraints:
4. $||a||^2 = 1$,
5. $||b||^2 = 1$,
6. $||c||^2 = 4$.
Additionally, the scalars λ1, λ2, λ3 are the Lagrange multipliers. So, equations (1)-(6). Hmm, this system of equations.
So, need to solve these six equations. Let’s see.
Let me try to unpack equations 1-3.
Equation 1: $\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c} = 2λ1 \mathbf{a}$
Equation 2: $\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{c} = 2λ2 \mathbf{b}$
Equation 3: $\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} = 2λ3 \mathbf{c}$
Note that each of these is a vector equation, so they must hold for each component. However, in general vectors.
But this is a linear combination of the vectors. Let’s see:
From equations 1, 2, 3.
If we can express a, b, c in terms of each other. Let me attempt to solve the system step by step.
From equation 3: $\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} = 2λ3 \mathbf{c}$
Therefore, $\mathbf{c} = (\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}) / (2λ3)$. Let's write that down.
Equation 1: substitute $\mathbf{c}$ here: $\mathbf{b} + (\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b})/(2λ3) = 2λ1 \mathbf{a}$
Multiply both sides by 2λ3 to eliminate denominator:
$2λ3 \mathbf{b} + (\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}) = 4λ1 λ3 \mathbf{a}$
Combine like terms:
$\mathbf{a} + (2λ3 + 1)\mathbf{b} = 4λ1 λ3 \mathbf{a}$
Bring similar terms to one side:
$\mathbf{a} - 4λ1 λ3 \mathbf{a} + (2λ3 + 1)\mathbf{b} = 0$
Factor out a:
$\mathbf{a}(1 - 4λ1 λ3) + \mathbf{b}(2λ3 + 1) = 0$
Since a and b are vectors (of norm 1, but not necessarily orthogonal), the only way this equation holds is if the coefficients of a and b are zero. Therefore:
$1 - 4λ1 λ3 = 0$,
and
$2λ3 + 1 = 0$.
From the second equation: $2λ3 + 1 = 0 ⇒ λ3 = -1/2$.
Then, substitute λ3 into first equation:
$1 - 4λ1 (-1/2) = 0 → 1 + 2λ1 = 0 → λ1 = -1/2$.
Okay, so, λ3 = -1/2, λ1 = -1/2.
Similarly, let's apply equation 2 and see.
Equation 2: $\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{c} = 2λ2 \mathbf{b}$
But $\mathbf{c}$ is expressed as $(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b})/(2λ3)$, which is $(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b})/(2*(-1/2)) ) = (\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b})/(-1) = -\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$
Therefore, equation 2 becomes:
$\mathbf{a} + (-\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) = 2λ2 \mathbf{b}$
Simplify the left side:
$\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} = -\mathbf{b} = 2λ2 \mathbf{b}$
Therefore: $-\mathbf{b} = 2λ2 \mathbf{b}$, which implies $-1 = 2λ2$, hence λ2 = -1/2.
So, all three Lagrange multipliers are -1/2. Interesting.
So now, with λ1 = λ2 = λ3 = -1/2, then we can get expressions for a, b, c.
From equation 3: $\mathbf{c} = (\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b})/(2λ3) = (\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b})/(2*(-1/2)) = (\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}) / (-1) = -\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$
So, $\mathbf{c} = -\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$
But also, given in the problem that ||c|| = 2. Let's check if this condition is met here.
Compute $||c||^2 = || -a - b ||^2 = ||a + b||^2 = ||a||^2 + ||b||^2 + 2\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}$. Since $||a||^2 = ||b||^2 = 1$, this is $1 + 1 + 2\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 2 + 2x$, where $x = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}$.
Determine the condition on $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}$.
But they need this to be equal to $||c||^2 = 4$.
So, $2 + 2x = 4 => 2x = 2 => x = 1$.
Conclude $\mathbf{a} = \mathbf{b}$ from the dot product result.
Wait, so $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 1$, which would mean that vectors a and b are parallel. Because their dot product equals the product of their norms (which is 1*1 =1).
So, if $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} =1$, then the angle between them is 0.
That is, a = b.
Analyze the specific configuration $\mathbf{a} = \mathbf{b}, \mathbf{c} = -2\mathbf{a}$.
So, if c = -a - b = -2a (since a = b).
Therefore, c is -2a, which has norm 2, as desired.
So if a and b are equal (and unit vectors), then c is -2a, which would have norm 2.
So this case is possible, but requires a and b being equal (and opposite direction for c, magnitude 2).
Calculate S for this configuration.
Wait, but in this case, if a = b, then we have $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} =1$, and then $\mathbf{c}=-2\mathbf{a}$, so then other dot products - let's compute $S = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a}$:
Substitute: $1 + \mathbf{b} \cdot (-2\mathbf{a}) + \mathbf{-2a} \cdot \mathbf{a}$
Since a and b are equal:
$= 1 + (-2)\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} + (-2)\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a}$
But $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} = 1$, so:

Sum:1 +25 +16=42.
Wait, but the expression evaluated to 30 -4S. If S=-3, $30 -4*(-3)=30 +12=42$, which matches the computation.
So this is one possibility. So the total expression can at least reach 42.
But we need to check if whether S can be lower than -3, so that 30 -4S becomes larger. So if S can reach a minimum more negative than -3, leading to 30 -4S being greater than 42. Therefore, is that possible?
Hmm. Wait, in the previous step, going through Lagrange multipliers, I found that Lagrange multiplier method gave a critical point when a =b and c=-2a, leading to S = -3. But is that a minima? Or maybe it's a saddle point?
Alternatively, perhaps there are other critical points where a, b, c are different vectors, rather than a =b.
Explore minimizing S via geometric arrangements.
Alternatively, the minimal value of S may be occurring here. Wait, but let's look into whether a's, b's, and c's relations, other configurations that give lower S.
Alternatively, perhaps vectors a, b, c form a triangle? But I'm not sure.
Wait, suppose c is -2a -2b, but in different proportions.
Alternatively, think about introducing variables.
Wait, given that a, b are unit vectors, and c is a vector of norm 2, perhaps the product they can arrange these vectors such that the negative dot products add up to a smaller S.
For instance, make $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}$ as small as possible (i.e., -1, but can they all do that?
Wait, let's consider trying other possibilities.
Analyze the antipodal case $\mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{b}$.
Case 1: Align a and b in such a way that θ_ab = 180 degrees, so that cosθ_ab = -1.
Then also, set the other angles as...
But c has magnitude 2, so $\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c}$ would be 2 cosθ_bc, minimum when cosθ_bc = -1, so that term is -2.
Similarly, $\mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a} = 2 cosθ_ca$, also minimized at -2.
Then S would be -1 (from a⋅b) + (-2) + (-2) = -5.
So if that's possible. But is there such a combination where a and b are antipodal (θ_ab=180), and vectors c forms 180 degrees with both a and b. However, in that case, vectors a, b are antipodal, c is pointing in opposite direction of a and b. But in order for vector c to be at 180 degrees from both a and b, which are themselves antipodal. Wait.
Let me try to make this concrete.
Let’s pick a = (1,0,0), b = (-1,0,0), so they are antipodal.
Let c be pointing in the direction of? Well, if c needs to be of length 2, and to have maximum negative dot products with both a and b. Then:
$\mathbf{c}$ must be pointing in the negative direction along a (to maximize the negative product with a), but a and b are antipodal. Hence, if c points in the direction of a, then it would have positive dot product with a (which we don't want), so to minimize both $\mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{b}$, perhaps c is zero vector? But no, because c is supposed to be magnitude 2.

1: For the arrangement where $\mathbf{c}$ is collinear with $\mathbf{a}$ (meaning $\mathbf{c}=2\mathbf{a}$), $S$ is calculated as $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a}$. Since $\mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{b}$, $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = -1$. The dot product $\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c}$ equals $(-\mathbf{a}) \cdot (2\mathbf{a}) = -2(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a}) = -2$, and the dot product $\mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a}$ equals $(2\mathbf{a}) \cdot \mathbf{a} = 2(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a})=2$. The total sum $S$ is $-1 - 2 + 2 = -1$.

2: In the case where $\mathbf{c}$ is collinear with $\mathbf{b}$ (implying $\mathbf{c}= -2\mathbf{a}$ since $\mathbf{b} = -\mathbf{a}$), the dot product $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}$ is $-1$. The dot product $\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c}$ is calculated as $(-\mathbf{a}) \cdot (-2\mathbf{a}) = 2(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a})= 2$. The dot product $\mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a}$ is calculated as $(-2\mathbf{a}) \cdot \mathbf{a}= -2(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a})= -2$. The total sum $S$ is therefore $-1 + 2 - 2 = -1$.

3: Consider the configuration where $\mathbf{c}$ is orthogonal to both $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$. In this configuration, $\mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a} = 0$ and $\mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 0$. The sum $S$ is then $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + 0 + 0 = -1$, given that $\mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{b}$ implies $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}=-1$. A direction for $\mathbf{c}$ that yields negative projections onto both $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ could be explored. Since $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ are antipodal and collinear, no single direction can be opposite to both.
If $\mathbf{c}$ is collinear with $\mathbf{a}$, then $\mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a} = \pm 2$ and $\mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \mp 2$.
This leads to the dot product pairs $(\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c}, \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a})$ being either $(-2, 2)$ or $(2, -2)$.
The sum $S = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a}$ evaluates to $S = -1 + (\pm 2) + (\mp 2) = -1$ in either collinear case.

<Conclusion>
When $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ are antipodal ($\mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{b}$), the sum $S = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a}$ evaluates to -1, irrespective of whether $\mathbf{c}$ is collinear with $\mathbf{a}$, collinear with $\mathbf{b}$, or orthogonal to both.

Determine minimum S is -1 for antipodal case.
If c is orthogonal to both a and b, then S= -1 +0 +0= -1. Hmmm. So regardless, if a and b are antipodal, S=-1 regardless of c's orientation. So how do we get lower S?
Compare antipodal result ($S=-1$) with Lagrange result ($S=-3$).
Wait, but in the earlier case where a and b are equal, Then c=-2a, leading to S=-1 + (-2) + (-2)= -1 -4= -5? Wait no.
Wait no, actually, if a and b are equal vectors. When we derived earlier, $\mathbf{a} = \mathbf{b}$.
Given c=-2a, so $S= \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a}$
$=1 + (b \cdot (-2a)) + (-2a \cdot a)$
$=1 + (-2(a \cdot a)) + (-2*1)$
$=1 -2 -2= -3$.
So in this case, S=-3, which is less than the S=-1 from the a and b antipodal case.
So, perhaps that arrangement gives S=-3.
But perhaps another configuration gives even lower S.
Analyze the orthogonal case $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 0$.
Wait, another configuration: suppose a and b are orthogonal, leading to $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}=0$. Then, maybe c can be arranged such that $\mathbf{c}$ has negative dot products with both.
suppose a and b are orthogonal, leading to $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}=0$.
Let's suppose a=(1,0,0), b=(0,1,0), orthogonal. Then, how to choose c vector (norm 2) to minimize the dot products.
$\mathbf{b} \cdot c =2\cosθ_bc$ to be minimized, thus θ_bc=180 degrees, so c= (x,y,z) where y=-2 (as dot product of b=(0,1,0) with c=(0,-2,0,) y component is 0*0 +1*(-2) +0*0= -2). Wait, but c of norm 2. So if c = (0,-2,0), then $\mathbf{b} \cdot c=0*0 +1*(-2) +0*0= -2$, hence cosineθ= -1 for that term.
Let's think in parallel.

Calculate total $S = 0 + (-2) + 0 = -2$.
Compare orthogonal result ($S=-2$) with previous minimum ($S=-3$).
Which seems better than S=-1 previously but worse than S=-3 if vectors are colinear.
So in this case, S=-2. So then the total original expression would be 30 -4*(-2) =38, which is less than 42.
But in these different configurations, the minimal possible S is ? At least we found -3. Maybe we can find S even lower. Let me think.
Wait, so when a, b, c related such that c is a linear combination of a and b? For example, in that earlier case where c is expressed as -2a -2b, but then...
Wait, but with c= -a -b from Lagrange multiplier, when a and b are equal, getting c= -2a. That gave a valid case. However, what if assume that a, b, c can all be in one plane and arranged to have different angles.
Analyze the symmetric case (120° angles).
Alternatively, suppose that in 3D space, we can manipulate angles in such a way that each angle θ_ab, θ_bc, θ_ca is 120 degrees. Let's check.
For instance, suppose the three vectors are arranged symmetrically, each at 120 degrees with each other.
But given that a and b are unit vectors and c has magnitude 2.
Hmm, let's say a, b, and c are arranged such that the angle between a and b is 120, the angle between each a and c is 120, b and c is 120. Then:
Let's think in parallel.

When the angle between each pair of vectors is assumed to be 120°, the dot products are $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = -0.5$, $\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} = -1$, and $\mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a} = -1$.

Calculate total $S = -0.5 - 1 - 1 = -2.5$.
So total S= -0.5 -1 -1= -2.5, which is S= -5/2.
Therefore, total expression would be 30 -4*(-5/2)=30 +10=40.
So, in this case, the total expression is 40. But previous configuration gave 42, but this is less. So so, maybe this is not the minimal S.
Alternatively, if θ_ab=180°, and θ_bc=θ_ca=90°, so aligning vectors opposingly.
Wait, but this would require:
a and b antipodal \implies. a = -b. Then c is in the plane perpendicular to a and b. But How?
Suppose a=(1,0,0), b=(-1,0,0), so $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}=-1$.
Then, c must satisfy being a vector with magnitude 2, say in z-direction.
Then, $\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c}= (-1,0,0) \cdot (0,0,2) =0$,
$\mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a}= (0,0,2) \cdot (1,0,0)=0$,
Hence, S= -1 +0 +0= -1.
If we arrange c in some direction where both dot products can be negative.
Wait, for example, z-component to be other.
Wait, To have maximum negative both $\mathbf{b} \cdot c$ and $\mathbf{c} \cdot a$, maybe arranging c pointing in the negative direction for both.
But if a and b are antipodal, when a is (1,0,0), b is (-1,0,0). Then the only way to have c pointing in the direction that is negative for both a and b would require components of x? But since a= (1,0,0) and b=(-1,0,0), then for c = (-k, 0, 0) has direction opposite to a, but same as b. Then:
$\mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a} = -k*1$,
$\Mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{b} = -k*(-1) =k*1$.
But k is constrained so that ||c||=2. For c=(-k,0,0), ||c||=k=2.
Hence,
$\mathbf{c} \cdot a = -2$,
$\mathbf{c} \cdot b=2$.
So $S = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a}= -1 +2 -2=-1$.
Same as before.
So cannot get both negative with other orientations.
Hmm. Looks like when a and b are colinear and maybe with c oriented toward some other direction.
Analyze the mutually orthogonal case.
Alternatively, what if a, b, c are mutually orthogonal? In this case:
$\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}=0$,
$\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c}=0$,
$\mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a}=0$,
Thus, S=0+0+0=0.
Then Original expression would be 30 -0=30. but this is minimal? No, cause original expr needs to be maximized. So 30 is minimal here.
But the maximum comes from minimal S. Hence when S is minimal.
But The previous case a=b, c=-2a gave S=-3.
Aother case, some vectors a, b forming an angle theta,and c arranged in such a way to give lower total S。
Hmm.
Alternatively, consider that the vectors exist in 3D,perhaps arranged to form a certain geometric shape.
Alternatively, using inequalities to bound S.
Recall that $S = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a}$.
Maybe applying Cauchy-Schwarz or triangle inequality.
But CS can upper bound dot products, but since we need a lower bound (to get upper bound on -4S hence on expression in problem),but perhaps bounding techniques。
Alternatively, let me rewrite S in terms of the given variables.
Alternatively consider that:
$S = \mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c}$.
Hmm. but that might not be helpful.
Alternatively, combine the terms.
Let me attempt to bind S:
Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality ($\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} \ge -||\mathbf{a}|| ||\mathbf{b}||$), but since S is a sum of three terms, maybe use various inequalities.
Explore using the norm of the sum $\|\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c}\|^2$.
Alternatively express S in terms of the squared norm of (a + b + c)?
Relate $\|\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c}\|^2$ to S.
Wait compute $||a + b + c||^2 = ||a||^2 + ||b||^2 + ||c||^2 + 2(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c})$
Substituting values, $1 +1 +4 +2S=6 +2S$.
Deduce minimizing S is equivalent to minimizing $K = \|\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c}\|^2$.
Thus, if $K = ||a + b + c||^2 =6 +2S$.
Then $S = (K -6)/2$.
Thus, to minimize S, we need to minimize $K = ||a + b + c||^2$.
Establish a lower bound for S using $K \ge 0$.
So since norms are non-negative, the smallest possible $||a + b + c||^2$ is zero.
But can the sum a + b + c be zero vector?
Since $S=(K -6)/2$. Since K >=0, as it's a squared norm.
=> K >=0 => (from equation S=(K-6)/2), therefore $(K -6)/2 \ge (0 -6)/2= -3$.
Therefore, the minimal S is -3.
Hence, maximum value of the original expression $30 -4S$ is $30 -4*(-3)=42$.
Verify that $S = -3$ is attainable when $K = 0$.
Before, when a and b are the same unit vector, c = -2a gives that $K=||a + b + c||^2=||a + a -2a||=0$, which attains S=-3. So yeah, seems like that's the case.
i.e., $a + b + c =0 \implies c= -a -b$.
Confirm the configuration for $\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$.
Write $\mathbf{c} = -\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$.
Then, $||c||= ||-a -b||=sqrt(||a||^2 ||b||^2)$. But $||a||=1,||b||=1$, so $||c||=sqrt(1 +1 +2\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b})$.
Substitute norms.
But given that ||c||must be 2.
So $sqrt(2 + 2x) =2$, where $x = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}$.
Thus, $2 + 2x =4 \implies x=1$, which implies $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}=1$, so a and b are colinear and pointing in the same direction (unit vectors with dot product 1 must be same vectors).
Hence, if a=b, then c= -2a, which fits since $||c||= sqrt(4||a||^2) =2$.
Deduce $\mathbf{c} = -2\mathbf{a}$.
Hence, S= (0 -6)/2= -3.
Which matches previous result.
Hence,this is achieved when a + b + c=0. But that only holds when c= -a -b as above.
Thus, the minimal possible S is -3, corresponding to $K=||a + b + c||^2=0$, leading to S=(0-6)/2=-3.
But since K is the squared norm, it cannot be negative, so the minimum of S being -3 in this case.
Conclude the minimum value of S is -3.
So, the overall minimal value of S is -3, and thus maximal value of the original expression is $30 -4*(-3)=30+12=42$.
Calculate the maximum value of the original expression.
But wait, however, question says "find the maximum value of the expression",which is expanded as 30 -4S. Hence, to maximize this, we need to minimize S.
The minimal S is shown to be -3.
Therefore, $30 -4*(-3)=42$.
But how do we know that S cannot. be smaller than -3?
Formulate the final answer as 42.
Hence, the answer is 42.
Hence, the maximum value is 42.
