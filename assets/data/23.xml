Okay, so I need to estimate the time \( t_{2} \) required for the radius of something—presumably a cloud or a sphere of gas—to shrink from an initial radius \( r_{0} \) to \( r_{2} = 0.95 r_{0} \). The problem also mentions neglecting the change in the gravity field at the position of a falling gas particle. Hmm. Let me think about how to approach this.
First, since we’re dealing with the collapse or shrinkage of a radius due to gravity, this might be related to free-fall collapse time in astrophysics.
I remember that the free-fall time is the timescale over which a cloud would collapse under its own gravity if there were no pressure support. The formula for the free-fall time is something like \( t_{\text{ff}} = \sqrt{\frac{3\pi}{32 G \rho}} \), where \( G \) is the gravitational constant and \( \rho \) is the density.
But wait, this might be when the object collapses to a much smaller radius, maybe even to a point. However, the problem here is a small contraction from \( r_{0} \) to \( 0.95 r_{0} \), so maybe we can't use the standard free-fall formula directly.
Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering each particle in the gas experiencing gravitational acceleration towards the center, and their infall time. Since we neglect the change in the gravity field, does that mean we assume the gravitational acceleration remains constant during the collapse? That would simplify things because then we can model the motion under constant acceleration.
Let's think in parallel.

1: Gravitational acceleration inside a sphere depends on the radius; for a uniform sphere, it is \( g(r) = -\frac{G M(r)}{r^2} \), where \( M(r) \) is the mass enclosed within radius \( r \). If the change in the gravity field is neglected, this implies that \( g \) is approximated as constant during the shrinkage. This could mean \( M(r) \) is approximated as the total mass \( M \), or that the mass within radius \( r \) is assumed to remain constant even as the cloud collapses and density increases, provided the total mass is fixed. For a gas particle at radius \( r \), the mass enclosed is \( M(r) = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \rho \).
Consequently, the gravitational acceleration is \( g(r) = -\frac{G \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \rho}{r^2} = -\frac{4}{3} \pi G \rho r \).
If the density \( \rho \) were assumed to stay approximately constant (which is not the case in reality as a cloud contracts and its density increases), the problem's instruction to neglect the change in the gravity field would still be the guiding principle.
This suggests that \( g \) should be treated as a constant value.
If so, \( g \) might be set to its initial value \( g = -\frac{4}{3} \pi G \rho r_0 \), evaluated at the initial radius.
The changing radius, however, presents a conflict with the notion of constant gravity if \(g\) is proportional to \(r\).
This situation introduces a conflict in the underlying assumptions.

<Path>
2: An assumption could be that the total mass \( M \) is fixed, with gravitational acceleration treated as \( g = -\frac{G M}{r^2} \). If \( r \) changes from \( r_0 \) to \( 0.95 r_0 \), the gravitational acceleration, being proportional to \( 1/r^2 \), would normally increase. Given the problem's instruction to neglect the change in the gravity field, \( g \) can be approximated as constant during the contraction. This could involve evaluating \( g \) at the initial radius \( r = r_0 \) and using this value throughout the contraction, which simplifies the problem to one of constant acceleration free-fall towards the center.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
If gravity is proportional to \( \rho r \), neglecting its change implies fixing it at its initial value, \( g_0 = \frac{4}{3}\pi G \rho_0 r_0 \), despite \( r \) and potentially \( \rho \) changing; this interpretation is required to maintain \( g \) as constant. If gravity is proportional to \( M/r^2 \), neglecting its change (despite \( r \) decreasing) implies fixing \( g \) at its initial value, \( g_0 = GM/r_0^2 \), for the calculation.

If we model each gas particle as starting at rest at radius \( r_0 \) and accelerating inward with a constant acceleration \( g = \frac{G M}{r_0^2} \). Wait, but gravity is directed inward, so maybe \( a = - \frac{G M}{r_0^2} \), but since the particle is moving inward, perhaps we need to consider the acceleration increasing as the particle moves inward, but the problem says to neglect the change in the gravity field. Therefore, we can approximate the acceleration as constant, \( g = \frac{G M}{r_0^2} \), during the entire motion from \( r_0 \) to \( 0.95 r_0 \).
But is \( M \) the mass enclosed? If the gas is uniform, initially, the mass enclosed is \( M = \frac{4}{3} \pi r_0^3 \rho \). But in that case, \( g = \frac{G \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi r_0^3 \rho}{r_0^2} = \frac{4}{3} \pi G \rho r_0 \).

1: Inside a sphere, gravitational acceleration varies with radius; for a uniform sphere, \( g(r) = -\frac{G M(r)}{r^2} \), where \( M(r) \) is the mass enclosed within radius \( r \). Neglecting changes in the gravity field implies that \( g \) is approximated as constant during shrinkage. This approximation could mean that \( M(r) \) is considered as the total mass \( M \), or that the mass within radius \( r \) remains constant during collapse even if density increases, assuming a fixed total mass. For a gas particle at radius \( r \), the enclosed mass is \( M(r) = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \rho \). Consequently, the gravitational acceleration is \( g(r) = -\frac{4}{3} \pi G \rho r \).
The directive to neglect gravity field changes remains the guiding principle, even if one were to assume constant density \( \rho \), an assumption that contradicts the increasing density of a contracting cloud.
The gravitational acceleration \( g \) is therefore treated as a constant value.
This constant \( g \) can be set to its initial value \( g = -\frac{4}{3} \pi G \rho r_0 \), determined at the initial radius.
A conflict arises with the concept of constant gravity when the radius changes, particularly if \(g\) is proportional to \(r\).
Such a scenario indicates an inherent conflict within the problem's foundational assumptions.

2: The total mass \( M \) can be assumed fixed, with gravitational acceleration given by \( g = -\frac{G M}{r^2} \). As \( r \) decreases from \( r_0 \) to \( 0.95 r_0 \), the gravitational acceleration, proportional to \( 1/r^2 \), would typically increase. However, due to the instruction to neglect changes in the gravity field, \( g \) is approximated as constant during contraction. This involves using the initial gravitational acceleration at \( r = r_0 \) throughout the process, simplifying the scenario to constant acceleration free-fall.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
Neglecting changes in the gravity field means that if gravity is proportional to \( \rho r \), it is fixed at its initial value \( g_0 = \frac{4}{3}\pi G \rho_0 r_0 \), irrespective of changes in \( r \) or \( \rho \), to maintain \( g \) as constant. Similarly, if gravity is proportional to \( M/r^2 \), it is fixed at its initial value \( g_0 = GM/r_0^2 \) for calculations, despite \( r \) decreasing.

However, the problem says to neglect the change in the gravity field at the position of a falling gas particle. Therefore, perhaps we need to approximate that as the particle falls, the gravitational acceleration it experiences doesn't change. So, even as the particle moves inward, the gravitational acceleration is the same as it was at \( r_0 \). This is an approximation, of course.
So, with that in mind, we can model the particle's motion as starting from rest at \( r = r_0 \) and moving under a constant acceleration \( g = \frac{G M}{r_0^2} \) directed inward. But which mass \( M \) are we talking about here? Let's clarify that. If the particle is part of the cloud, then the mass enclosed when it is at radius \( r \) is the mass inside radius \( r \). But if we are neglecting the change in gravity field, perhaps the acceleration is calculated based on the initial mass enclosed.
Wait, if all the mass is inside \( r_0 \), then initially, at \( r = r_0 \), the mass enclosed is \( M \). If the gas cloud starts to collapse, as the particle moves inward, say to \( r = 0.95 r_0 \), the mass enclosed would be greater? Because more mass is inside the smaller radius. Wait, no—I'm confusing things here. Actually, if you're at radius \( r \), the mass enclosed is \( M(r) = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \rho \). If the collapse is homogeneous and uniform, then \( \rho(t) \) is uniform but increasing as \( r \) decreases. So, \( M(r) = \frac{4}{3} \pi r(t)^3 \rho(t) \). Since mass is conserved, the total mass \( M = \frac{4}{3} \pi r_0^3 \rho_0 \), so \( \rho(t) = \rho_0 \left( \frac{r_0}{r(t)} \right)^3 \). Substituting into \( g(r) \), we get \( g(r) = -\frac{G \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \rho(t)}{r^2} = -\frac{4}{3} \pi G \rho(t) r \). Plugging \( \rho(t) = \rho_0 (r_0 / r)^3 \), then \( g(r) = -\frac{4}{3} \pi G \rho_0 \frac{r_0^3}{r^2} \). But since \( M = \frac{4}{3} \pi r_0^3 \rho_0 \), the gravitational acceleration simplifies to \( g(r) = -\frac{G M}{r^2} \), same as the gravitational acceleration outside a mass shell.
Wait, actually, inside a uniform sphere, the gravitational acceleration at radius \( r \) is \( g(r) = -\frac{G M(r)}{r^2} \), and \( M(r) = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \rho \), so combining these gives \( g(r) = -\frac{4}{3} \pi G \rho r \). But if density \( \rho \) is increasing as the cloud collapses, then \( g(r) \) is not linear in \( r \) anymore. But this is getting complicated.
But the problem says to neglect the change in the gravity field at the position of a falling gas particle. So, if we are to treat \( g \) as constant, even as the particle moves, then effectively, we can use a constant acceleration approximation. Therefore, even though in reality the acceleration would increase as the particle moves inward, we are told to ignore that and just take \( g \) at its initial value. So, at \( r = r_0 \), \( g = -\frac{G M}{r_0^2} \). Then, treating this as a constant acceleration, even though \( M \) would actually change if the density changes. However, in the problem's approximation, because we neglect the change in gravity, so both \( M \) and \( r \) in the gravity formula remain fixed at their initial values, so \( g = -\frac{G M}{r_0^2} \), constant.
Given that, we can model the acceleration as constant. Then, the problem reduces to a simple kinematics problem of a particle starting from rest at position \( r_0 \), accelerating towards the center with constant acceleration \( g \), and we want to find the time \( t_2 \) when the position is \( 0.95 r_0 \).
Wait, but here's a problem: if we have constant acceleration, then the equation of motion is \( r(t) = r_0 + \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \). But since it's moving inward, the acceleration is negative. So, \( a = -g \), where \( g \) is positive. Let's set up the coordinate system such that the center is at 0, and the initial position is \( r_0 \). The acceleration is \( -g \), so the equation is: \( r(t) = r_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \).
Since starting from rest, \( v_0 = 0 \), so: \( r(t) = r_0 - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 \).
Wait, but this is the standard equation for distance under constant acceleration. Let me check again. No, hold on: actually, for motion under constant acceleration, the position is \( x(t) = x_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \). If starting from rest, \( v_0 = 0 \), so \( x(t) = x_0 + \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \). But in this case, the acceleration is towards the center, so the acceleration is negative.
So perhaps: If we set \( r(t) \) as the distance from the center: then \( r(t) = r_0 - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 \). But this would imply that \( r(t) \) decreases quadratically.
However, if we use this equation, then we set \( r(t) = 0.95 r_0 \) and solve for \( t \): \( 0.95 r_0 = r_0 - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 \).
So, \( \frac{1}{2} g t^2 = r_0 - 0.95 r_0 = 0.05 r_0 \).
Thus, \( t^2 = \frac{0.10 r_0}{g} \).
\( t = \sqrt{\frac{0.10 r_0}{g}} \).
But \( g = \frac{G M}{r_0^2} \), so substituting: \( t = \sqrt{\frac{0.10 r_0}{\frac{G M}{r_0^2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.10 r_0^3}{G M}} \).
But \( M = \frac{4}{3} \pi r_0^3 \rho \), assuming a uniform sphere with initial density \( \rho \). Then, \( t = \sqrt{\frac{0.10 r_0^3}{G \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi r_0^3 \rho}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.10 \times 3}{4 \pi G \rho}} \times \sqrt{\frac{r_0^3}{r_0^3}} \).
Simplifying, \( t = \sqrt{\frac{0.30}{4 \pi G \rho}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{0.075}{\pi G \rho}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{0.0239}{G \rho}} \).
But the free-fall time \( t_{\text{ff}} \) is \( \sqrt{\frac{3\pi}{32 G \rho}} \approx 0.5 \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{G \rho}} \approx 0.5 \times 1.77 \sqrt{\frac{1}{G \rho}} \approx 0.886 \sqrt{\frac{1}{G \rho}} \).
Comparing this to the above, my calculation gives \( \sqrt{\frac{0.0239}{G \rho}} \approx 0.1546 \sqrt{\frac{1}{G \rho}} \). So about 15% of the free-fall time. However, perhaps my approach is not correct.
Wait a minute, why? Because the equation \( r(t) = r_0 - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 \) assumes constant acceleration, which is valid only if the acceleration doesn't change. But since the acceleration is actually dependent on radius, which is changing, this approximation might not be very accurate. However, the problem statement tells us to neglect the change in the gravity field, meaning to treat \( g \) as constant. Therefore, even if the kinematic equation isn't perfectly accurate in reality, according to the problem's stipulation, we can proceed with this approximation.
But let me think again. If we take \( g \) constant, then solving for \( t \) when the radius is reduced by 5% (from \( r_0 \) to \( 0.95 r_0 \)), the displacement is \( 0.05 r_0 \). The formula used above comes from assuming constant acceleration.
But displacement \( s = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \), where \( a = g \). But \( s = 0.05 r_0 \).
Wait, but hold on! If we are considering movement under a constant acceleration, we can use kinematic equations. However, in this case, the acceleration is directed towards the center, hence the displacement would be proportional to \( t^2 \). So solving \( 0.05 r_0 = \frac{1}{2} g t^2 \), hence \( t = \sqrt{ \frac{0.10 r_0}{g} } \).
Then, substituting \( g = \frac{G M}{r_0^2} \), gives: \( t = \sqrt{ \frac{0.10 r_0}{ \frac{G M}{r_0^2} } } = \sqrt{ \frac{0.10 r_0^3}{G M} } \).
But since \( M = \frac{4}{3} \pi r_0^3 \rho \), substituting: \( t = \sqrt{ \frac{0.10 r_0^3}{ G \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi r_0^3 \rho } } = \sqrt{ \frac{0.10 \cdot 3}{4 \pi G \rho } } = \sqrt{ \frac{0.075}{ \pi G \rho } } \approx \sqrt{ \frac{0.02387}{ G \rho } } \).
Yes, as above. To get a numerical value, perhaps we can relate this to the free-fall time, but maybe expressed in terms of \( t_{\text{ff}} \). However, the problem asks for an expression in terms relevant to the given parameters. Wait, but in the problem statement, are there any specific parameters given? The problem mentions radius shrinking from \( r_0 \) to \( 0.95 r_0 \), but no other specifics. Probably, the answer should be written in terms of \( r_0 \), \( G \), \( M \), or other given quantities. But maybe in the original question, part ii might follow part i, which could have introduced variables. Since in the user instruction, they just say part ii. However, since I don't have the full context, I need to assume reasonable parameters.
Let's think in parallel.

1: Alternatively, since we ended up with: \( t = \sqrt{ \frac{0.10 r_0^3}{G M} } \), assuming \( M \) is the mass of the cloud. If I don't have other expressions, maybe leave it as that.
Alternatively, if I express this in terms of the free-fall time \( t_{\text{ff}} \), which is typically \( \sqrt{ \frac{3 \pi}{32 G \rho } } \approx \sqrt{ \frac{1}{G \rho } } \times 0.55 \). To relate \( t_{2} \) to \( t_{\text{ff}} \), but perhaps that’s not necessary. If the problem is expecting the form in terms of \( r_0 \), \( G \), and \( M \), then the expression above is the way to go.
But wait, in the step before: \( t = \sqrt{ \frac{0.10 r_0}{g} } \), and \( g = \frac{G M}{r_0^2 } \), so: \( t = \sqrt{ \frac{0.10 r_0^3}{G M} } \).
Alternatively, since \( t_{\text{ff}} \) is \( \approx \sqrt{\frac{r_0^3}{G M}} } \times \sqrt{ \frac{3\pi}{32} } \), so that the time scale here is in terms of \( t_{\text{ff}} \times \sqrt{0.10 / (3 \pi/ 32)} \), which is about \( t_{\text{ff}} \times \sqrt{0.10 \times 32 / (3 \pi)} } \approx \sqrt{0.10*32/(9.42)} } \approx sqrt(0.339)≈0.58. So approximately 0.58 t_ff, but perhaps this is more detailed than needed.

2: Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider energy. If each particle is moving under gravity induced by the mass inside, but in this case, with constant acceleration. Alternatively, by solving the equation of motion.
But wait, alternatively, perhaps they are assuming radial free-fall with zero energy, and use Kepler’s laws? Wait, I'm getting confused.
Alternatively, perhaps use a differential equation. Let’s model the motion properly. Let’s avoid the constant acceleration assumption.

<Path>
3: The true equation of motion for a particle under gravity as it falls toward the center of a mass distribution. If we consider a gas particle at radius r(t), assuming that the mass enclosed M(r) is fixed (but actually, M(r) = M if all mass is inside r0, but as the cloud collapses, M(r) would be larger. Wait no, when the cloud collapses, if the total mass is M, then the mass enclosed within radius r(t) would still be M if the entire cloud collapses uniformly. Wait, but if a gas particle is inside the cloud, then the gravitational acceleration is due to the mass interior to its position. Hmm.
But if the gas is uniform, and we are considering a particle at radius r(t), then the mass interior to that radius is M(r(t)) = M * (r(t)/R(t))^3, where R(t) is the radius of the cloud at time t. If the collapse is uniform, then R(t) is the radius of the cloud, and all particles move radially inward with velocities proportional to their radius. But this is getting into more complex fluid dynamics. Possibly, the system is governed by the equations of gravitational collapse. But again, the problem says to neglect the change in the gravity field, so perhaps the acceleration is treated as constant. Hence, starting from the assumption of constant acceleration due to gravity.
But I need to resolve this. Let's approach it step-by-step. 1. Scenario: A gas cloud with initial radius \( r_0 \). It undergoes collapse such that a gas particle at the edge (or at radius \( r_0 \)) falls inward. We want to find the time \( t_2 \) for the radius to shrink to \( 0.95 r_0 \). Neglect the change in the gravity field at the position of the falling gas particle. 2. Neglecting the change in gravity field: implies that as the gas particle moves from \( r_0 \) to \( 0.95 r_0 \), the gravitational acceleration it experiences remains constant, equal to its initial value at \( r_0 \). 3. Therefore, even though the particle moves closer to the center, the gravity is fixed at \( g(r_0) = \frac{G M}{r_0^2} \). 4. Thus, we can model the motion of the particle under constant acceleration \( a = -g(r_0) = -\frac{G M}{r_0^2} \). 5. The motion is one-dimensional (radial) with constant acceleration. Starting from rest at \( r = r_0 \), the position as a function of time is: \( r(t) = r_0 - \frac{1}{2} g(r_0) t^2 \). 6. Solving for \( t \) when \( r(t) = 0.95 r_0 \): \( 0.95 r_0 = r_0 - \frac{1}{2} \frac{G M}{r_0^2} t^2 \). Simplify: \( \frac{1}{2} \frac{G M}{r_0^2} t^2 = 0.05 r_0 \). Multiply both sides by \( 2 \frac{r_0^2}{G M} \): \( t^2 = 0.10 \frac{r_0^3}{G M} \). Take square root: \( t = \sqrt{ \frac{0.10 r_0^3}{G M} } \). Therefore, \( t_2 = \sqrt{ \frac{0.10 r_0^3}{G M} } \).
But is there a way to write \( t_2 \) in terms of the free-fall time, or perhaps express it more simply? Alternatively, since typically the free-fall time \( t_{\text{ff}} \) is given by: \( t_{\text{ff}} = \sqrt{\frac{3 \pi}{32 G \rho}} \). But with \( \rho = \frac{3 M}{4 \pi r_0^3} \), substituting: \( t_{\text{ff}} = \sqrt{\frac{3 \pi}{32 G} \cdot \frac{4 \pi r_0^3}{3 M}} } = \sqrt{ \frac{\pi^2 r_0^3}{8 G M} } \approx \sqrt{ \frac{1.2337 r_0^3}{G M} } \). Therefore, the free-fall time is approximately \( t_{\text{ff}} \approx 1.11 \sqrt{ r_0^3 / (G M) } \). Comparing to our expression for \( t_2 \approx \sqrt{0.10 r_0^3/(G M)} } \approx 0.316 \sqrt{ r_0^3/(G M) } \), so \( t_2 \approx 0.316 / 1.11 t_{\text{ff}} \approx 0.285 t_{\text{ff}} \).
But unless there's a specific request to relate it to the free-fall time, perhaps the expected answer is just \( t_2 = \sqrt{0.10 r_0^3/(G M)} } \), or in a simplified form. Alternatively, using \( \sqrt{0.10} \approx 0.316 \), so that \( t_2 \approx 0.316 \sqrt{r_0^3/(G M)} \). However, it's possible that the assumption in the problem leads to a different result. For instance, if instead, the gravitational acceleration is approximated as \( g = \frac{G M(r_0)}{r_0^2} \), where \( M(r_0) = \frac{4}{3} \pi r_0^3 \rho_0 \), then replacing \( M \) in terms of \( \rho_0 \): \( M = \frac{4}{3} \pi r_0^3 \rho_0 \). Therefore: \( t_2 = \sqrt{ 0.10 \cdot \frac{r_0^3}{G \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi r_0^3 \rho_0 } } = \sqrt{ \frac{0.10 \cdot 3}{4 \pi G \rho_0} } = \sqrt{ \frac{0.075}{\pi G \rho_0} } \approx \sqrt{ \frac{0.0239}{G \rho_0} } \). But again, this could be expressed as a fraction of the free-fall time. However, since they asked to estimate the time \( t_{2} \), and unless they want the answer expressed in terms of \( t_{\text{ff}} \), the exact answer is what I derived above.

4: Wait, perhaps even this approach is deficient. Maybe instead of considering a single particle starting from rest, perhaps due to gravitational collapse of the cloud as a whole, the time can be found via more accurate analysis. Let me recall that for a particle free-falling from rest at r0 due to the gravitational field of a mass M, which is constant (when the particle is outside the mass), the free-fall time is indeed different, but when it's inside the mass distribution, the acceleration is different and not sure.
Alternatively, if the whole cloud is collapsing, then all layers are collapsing at the same time, but in the problem we’re told to change the radius from \( r0 \) to \( 0.95 r0 \), which is a small change. Therefore, perhaps it's sufficient to compute the time using linearized equations.
Alternatively, I might think to turn to the equation of motion for gravitational collapse. Let's consider a test particle at radius r(t) in a pressureless, self-gravitating sphere. For such a case, the equation governing the collapse is derived from the gravitational acceleration: \( \frac{d^2 r}{dt^2} = - \frac{G M(r)}{r^2} \). If we assume that mass enclosed within radius r is constant (i.e., that shells do not cross and each shell's mass is conserved), then if we start from rest, then the equation of motion is indeed: \( \ddot{r} = - \frac{G M}{r^2} \), where \( M = \frac{4}{3} \pi r_0^3 \rho_0 \). This is a differential equation. This might be a more accurate approach, but the problem says to neglect the change in the gravity field, so maybe that suggests to assume \( M \) is constant (no shell crossing) and to approximate the gravitational acceleration as constant? No. Wait, actually “neglect the change of the gravity field at the position of a falling gas particle” – okay, so even though the particle moves, the gravitational acceleration doesn't change. So when the particle is at 0.95 r0, we still use the same gravitational acceleration as at r0. Thus implying that \( g = \frac{G M}{r0^2} \) is constant.
Therefore, this brings us back to the initial derivation. Therefore the solution comes down to simple kinematics under constant acceleration. Hence, setting \( \Delta r = 0.05 r_0 \), displacement \( s = 0.05 r_0 \), starting from rest, so \( s = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \), hence \( t = \sqrt{2s/g} \). Since displacement here is inward, but in magnitude, yes. Therefore: \( t = \sqrt{2 * 0.05 r_0 / g} \), and \( g = G M / r0^2 \), hence: \( t = \sqrt{ (0.10 r0) / (G M / r0^2) ) } \), which simplifies to: \( t = \sqrt{0.10 r0^3 / (G M)} \). Which is the same as before.
Therefore, this seems to be consistent.

Path 1: The time \(t_2 = \sqrt{0.10 r_0^3 / (G M)}\) can be equivalently written as \(t_2 = \sqrt{0.10 r_0 / g}\) where \(g = GM/r_0^2\), or related to \(t_{ff}\) (e.g., \(t_2 \approx 0.58 t_{ff}\) for a specific \(t_{ff}\) definition relating \(t_{ff}\) to \(\sqrt{r_0^3/GM}\)).
Path 2: Energy conservation under constant force is equivalent to kinematics. Solving the exact differential equation for gravity (e.g., \(\ddot{r} = -GM/r^2\)) is more complex and contradicts the "neglect change in gravity field" simplification which implies constant acceleration.
Path 3: A consistent derivation using \(r(t) = r_0 - \frac{1}{2} g t^2\) with constant \(g = GM/r_0^2\) yields \(t_2 = \sqrt{0.10 r_0^3 / (G M)}\). This can also be expressed as \(t_2 = \sqrt{0.075 / (\pi G \rho_0)}\) if \(M\) is substituted with initial density, or \(t_2 \approx 0.285 t_{ff}\) (using the standard definition \(t_{ff} = \sqrt{\pi^2 r_0^3 / (8GM)}\)).
Path 4: While more sophisticated collapse models exist, the problem's directive to "neglect the change of the gravity field" strongly supports using a constant acceleration equal to the initial gravitational acceleration. Kinematic equations for constant acceleration applied to the displacement \(0.05 r_0\) reconfirm \(t_2 = \sqrt{0.10 r_0^3 / (G M)}\).

Alternatively, perhaps if the gravitational acceleration is \( g = (4/3) \pi G \rho r \), then if we take the initial value at \( r = r0 \), then \( g0 = (4/3) \pi G \rho0 * r0 \). But then, under constant density (which may not be valid if the cloud is collapsing), but since the problem asks to neglect gravitational acceleration change, perhaps keeping g fixed at \( g0 = (4/3) \pi G \rho * r0 \). But if the density ρ is increasing as the cloud collapses, then even under g constant the acceleration can't remain so, hence the problem says to neglect that. Wait, but problem says "Neglect the change of the gravity field at the position of a falling gas particle." Therefore, regardless of varying density and radius during collapse, assume that each particle feels a constant gravitational acceleration equal to the initial value. Under that assumption, it's a simple kinematics problem with constant acceleration. Hence, back to the position equation: starting at rest at \( r0 \), moving with constant acceleration \( g = G M / r0^2 \). Then, \( \Delta r = \frac{1}{2} g t^2 \), hence, \( 0.05 r0 = \frac{1}{2} (G M / r0^2) t^2 \), so, \( t^2 = (0.10 r0^3)/(G M) \), so, \( t = \sqrt{0.10 r0^3 / (G M)} \). But you may also write the answer in terms of the free-fall time. Since the standard free-fall time is: \( t_{\text{ff}} = \sqrt{\frac{3 \pi}{32 G \rho}} \). But since \( \rho = \frac{3 M}{4 \pi r0^3} \), then, \( t_{\text{ff}} = \sqrt{\frac{3 \pi}{32 G} \cdot \frac{4 \pi r0^3}{3 M}} } = \sqrt{\frac{\pi^2 r0^3}{8 G M}} } \), so, \( t = \sqrt{\frac{0.10 r0^3}{G M}} } \approx \sqrt{0.10 \times (8/\pi^2)} \times t_{\text{ff}} \approx \sqrt{0.10 \times 0.811} \times t_{\text{ff}} } \approx \sqrt{0.0811} \times t_{\text{ff}} } \approx 0.285 t_{\text{ff}} \). But since the problem does not mention expressing the answer in terms of free-fall time, maybe just leaving the answer as: \( t_2 = \sqrt{ \frac{0.10 r_0^3 }{ G M } } \). Alternatively, if the mass M is expressed in terms of the initial density ρ and r0, then substituting \( M = \frac{4}{3} \pi r0^3 \rho \), so, \( t_2 = \sqrt{ \frac{0.10 r0^3 }{ G \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi r0^3 \rho } } } = \sqrt{ \frac{0.10 \times 3 }{ 4 \pi G \rho } } = \sqrt{ \frac{0.30 }{ 4 \pi G \rho } } = \sqrt{ \frac{0.075}{ \pi G \rho } } \). But it may depend on what is considered appropriate. But the question says "Estimate the time \( t_{2} needed...", and likely expects the answer expressed in terms of variables within the problem, such as r0, M, G. Since the original problem statement presumably mentions these variables (radius, gravity, etc.), the answer would likely involve those.
Alternatively, if we consider that they might expect the time to be computed in a different approach, say via energy conservation. Wait. Hold on. Let’s consider energy. If you model the particle's motion from \( r_0 \) to \( 0.95 r_0 \), starting from rest, and assuming that gravitational potential energy is converted to kinetic energy, with the gravitational acceleration fixed at initial value. However, this is equivalent to the constant acceleration approach. If potential energy per unit mass is \( \phi = - \frac{G M}{r} \). The change in potential energy from \( r0 \) to \( 0.95 r0 \) is \( \Delta \phi = - \frac{G M}{0.95 r0} + \frac{G M}{r0} = \frac{G M}{r0} \left(1 - \frac{1}{0.95} \right) = \frac{G M}{r0} ( - 0.0526 ) \approx -0.0526 \frac{G M}{r0} \). But the kinetic energy gained would be \( \frac{1}{2} v^2 = - \Delta \phi \), so \( v \approx \sqrt{ 2 * 0.0526 \frac{G M}{r0} } \). But in the case of constant acceleration, kinematics gives us that the time is related to the displacement through \( t = \sqrt{2 s / a } \), so no, energy might not directly give time unless integrated appropriately, but probably this is redundant. Since the initial derivation is straightforward. Therefore, given the problem's constraint of neglecting gravity changes, the answer \( t_2 = \sqrt{\frac{0.10 r0^3}{G M}}} \) is acceptable. But according to the calculations, this answer seems reasonable. However, usually, in an examination or homework problem, when the radius doesn't change too much, and acceleration is considered constant, this approach is valid for small changes. Here, 5% change is small, so the result should be approximately correct.
So, final answer: \( \boxed{ t_2 = \sqrt{ \dfrac{0.1 r_0^3}{G M} } } \) Wait, but should the answer be expressed in terms of the density instead? Since M isn't always given. Yes, alternatively. But whether to write in terms of \( \rho \) or \( M \) it depends on the problem's context. Considering that often in gravitational collapse problems, we express quantities in terms of density. But if the problem has defined M, then it's okay. Since part ii. is presented here mentioning "radius to shrink", and neglected gravity changes, I think the answer is safest written in terms of \( r_0 \), \( G \), and \( M \) as \( \boxed{ \sqrt{ \dfrac{0.1 r_0^3}{G M} } } \). However, since M is \( \frac{4}{3} \pi r_0^3 \rho \), substituting M may lead to an answer in terms of \( \rho \), which for some is more fundamental. So another version: \( t_2 = \sqrt{ \dfrac{0.1 \times 3 }{ 4 \pi G \rho } } } = \sqrt{ \dfrac{0.075}{ \pi G \rho } } \approx 0.154 \sqrt{ \dfrac{1}{G \rho } } \). But then, maybe the numerical factor is left computed as fractions. So, exact expression is \( \sqrt{ 3 / (40 \pi G \rho ) } \). But the problem says "estimate", so perhaps approximate numbers are allowed, but exact expression is better. Again, as \( t_2 = \sqrt{0.1 r0^3 / (G M)} \) is also precise. So if writing in terms of \( M \), it's \( \boxed{ \sqrt{ \dfrac{0.1 r_0^3}{G M} } } \). If written in terms of rho, it's \( \boxed{ \sqrt{ \dfrac{0.075}{ \pi G \rho } } } \). Hmm.
But since the problem statement refers to "the radius" and "gravity field at the position of a falling gas particle", and neglecting  change in gravity, which is often phrased in terms of local g. So mentioning g as a constant, local. So perhaps if we phrase the answer in terms of the initial gravitational acceleration. Since the acceleration is \( g = \frac{G M}{r_0^2} \Rightarrow t = \sqrt{ \frac{0.10 r_0 }{ g } } \). So: \( t_2 = \sqrt{ \frac{0.10 r_0 }{ g } } \). But since \( g = \frac{G M}{r_0^2} \), that ties back to original expressions. In an exam setting, probably expressing in terms of \( g \), or the given variables whichever is more direct. However, considering that the problem said to neglect change in gravity field, but didn't specify whether M is given or other variables. If I have to present the answer using only the most fundamental variables, i.e., r0 and the gravitational parameters, using either M or rho, but if M is given, then the first form. If rho is given, the second. But since density would be \( \rho = \frac{M}{(4/3) \pi r_0^3} \), substituting into the free-fall time: But the problem possibly wants it as requested, possibly expecting use of constant acceleration, leading to simple sqrt(0.1 r_03/(G M )). Therefore, best to write it as this. It's plausible that answer is expected in terms of the gravitational acceleration at the initial position. Since if one writes the time as: time = sqrt(2 * distance / acceleration ). The distance was 0.05 r0, acceleration was G M / r02. Therefore, time = sqrt(2 * 0.05 r0 / (G M / r02 )) = sqrt( 0.1 r03 / (G M ) ), which as we derived. Yes, so I conclude that the answer is: \( \boxed{ t_2 = \sqrt{ \dfrac{0.1 r_0^3}{G M} } } \) However, given that the problem mentions "Neglect the change of the gravity field at the position of a falling gas particle", then if gravity field here refers to little g as the gravitational acceleration, and as it remains constant during the fall, another approach. Alternatively, assume that the gravitational acceleration remains constant, which is g = (4/3) π G ρ r  when you are inside a homogeneous cloud. Initially, the acceleration at r0 is g0 = (4/3) π G ρ0 r0. If the density doesn’t change (which is not true, but if we neglect changes in gravity field, maybe assume density doesn’t change), then: g = (4/3) π G ρ0 r(t). But r(t) = r0 - Δr. But according to neglecting the change in the gravity field, we set ρ = ρ0 and approximate g ≈ (4/3) π G ρ0 r0, constant. But since r(t) changes, then in reality, the acceleration should decrease as the particle approaches the center, but problem says neglect that. Hence, let's approximate g = (4/3) π G ρ0 r0. Then the same approach again: 0.05 r0 = 0.5 * [(4/3) π G ρ0 r0] * t2, so t2 = (0.10 r0) / [(4/3) π G ρ0 r0)] = 0.10 / ( (4/3) π G ρ0 ) = 0.075 / ( π G ρ0 ) Thus, t = sqrt(0.075 / (π G ρ0 )) ≈ sqrt(0.0239 / ( G ρ0 )). Expressed in terms of free-fall time: The free-fall time is sqrt(3π/(32 G ρ0 )) ≈ 0.557 / sqrt( G ρ0 ), so: t ≈ sqrt(0.0239 / ( G ρ0 )) ≈ 0.1546 / sqrt( G ρ0 ). Compared to free-fall time approximately 0.557 / sqrt(G rho). Therefore, t ≈ 0.277 t_ff. Alternatively, the initial expression with density: Using t = sqrt(0.075/(π G ρ0 )). But in any case, there are multiple expressions possible, which depends on how the variables are presented. Given that in the problem statement, unless M is a given parameter or rho, one needs to pick variables. Since the problem mentions that we're to estimate the time for radius to shrink, so they probably expect in terms of r0 and physical variables like G, M. Therefore, given the options, probably answer is express boxed as sqrt(0.1 r0^3 / (G M)).
\boxed{ t_2 = \sqrt{ \dfrac{0.1 r_0^3}{G M} } }
